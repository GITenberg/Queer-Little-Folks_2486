<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span><i>HEN
THAT HATCHED DUCKS</i>.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A STORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a nice young hen
that we will call Mrs. Feathertop.&nbsp; She was a hen of most
excellent family, being a direct descendant of the Bolton Grays,
and as pretty a young fowl as you could wish to see of a
summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; She was, moreover, as fortunately
situated in life as it was possible for a hen to be.&nbsp; She
was bought by young Master Fred Little John, with four or five
family connections of hers, and a lively young cock, who was held
to be as brisk a scratcher and as capable a head of a family as
any half-dozen sensible hens could desire.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that at first Mrs. Feathertop was a very
sensible hen.&nbsp; She was very pretty and lively, to be sure,
and a great favourite with Master Bolton Gray Cock, on account of
her bright eyes, her finely shaded feathers, and certain saucy
dashing ways that she had which seemed greatly to take his
fancy.&nbsp; But old Mrs. Scratchard, living in the neighbouring
yard, assured all the neighbourhood that Gray Cock was a fool for
thinking so much of that flighty young thing; <i>that</i> she had
not the smallest notion how to get on in life, and thought of
nothing in the world but her own pretty feathers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wait till she comes to have chickens,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Scratchard; &ldquo;then you will see.&nbsp; I have brought up ten
broods myself&mdash;as likely and respectable chickens as ever
were a blessing to society&mdash;and I think I ought to know a
good hatcher and brooder when I see her; and I know <i>that</i>
fine piece of trumpery, with her white feathers tipped with gray,
never will come down to family life.&nbsp; <i>She</i> scratch for
chickens!&nbsp; Bless me, she never did anything in all her days
but run round and eat the worms which somebody else scratched up
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Master Bolton Gray heard this he crowed very loudly, like
a cock of spirit, and declared that old Mrs. Scratchard was
envious, because she had lost all her own tail-feathers, and
looked more like a worn-out old feather-duster than a respectable
hen, and that therefore she was filled with sheer envy of anybody
that was young and pretty.&nbsp; So young Mrs. Feathertop cackled
gay defiance at her busy rubbishy neighbour, as she sunned
herself under the bushes on fine June afternoons.</p>
<p>Now Master Fred Little John had been allowed to have these
hens by his mamma on the condition that he would build their
house himself, and take all the care of it; and to do Master Fred
justice, he executed the job in a small way quite
creditably.&nbsp; He chose a sunny sloping bank covered with a
thick growth of bushes, and erected there a nice little hen-house
with two glass windows, a little door, and a good pole for his
family to roost on.&nbsp; He made, moreover, a row of nice little
boxes with hay in them for nests, and he bought three or four
little smooth white china eggs to put in them, so that, when his
hens <i>did</i> lay, he might carry off their eggs without their
being missed.&nbsp; This hen-house stood in a little grove that
sloped down to a wide river, just where there was a little cove
which reached almost to the hen-house.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image15" href="images/p15b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Erecting the Hen-House"
title=
"Erecting the Hen-House"
 src="images/p15s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This situation inspired one of Master Fred&rsquo;s boy
advisers with a new scheme in relation to his poultry
enterprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hallo!&nbsp; I say, Fred,&rdquo; said
Tom Seymour, &ldquo;you ought to raise ducks; you&rsquo;ve got a
capital place for ducks there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I&rsquo;ve bought <i>hens</i>, you see,&rdquo;
said Freddy; &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s no use trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use!&nbsp; Of course there is.&nbsp; Just as if your
hens couldn&rsquo;t hatch ducks&rsquo; eggs.&nbsp; Now you just
wait till one of your hens wants to sit, and you put ducks&rsquo;
eggs under her, and you&rsquo;ll have a family of ducks in a
twinkling.&nbsp; You can buy ducks&rsquo; eggs a plenty of old
Sam under the hill.&nbsp; He always has hens hatch his
ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Freddy thought it would be a good experiment, and informed
his mother the next morning that he intended to furnish the ducks
for the next Christmas dinner and when she wondered how he was to
come by them, he said mysteriously, &ldquo;Oh, I will show you
how,&rdquo; but did not further explain himself.&nbsp; The next
day he went with Tom Seymour and made a trade with old Sam, and
gave him a middle-aged jack-knife for eight of his ducks&rsquo;
eggs.&nbsp; Sam, by-the-by, was a woolly-headed old negro man,
who lived by the pond hard by, and who had long cast envying eyes
on Fred&rsquo;s jack-knife, because it was of extra fine steel,
having been a Christmas present the year before.&nbsp; But Fred
knew very well there were any number more of jack-knives where
that came from, and that, in order to get a new one, he must
dispose of the old; so he made the purchase and came home
rejoicing.</p>
<p>Now about this time Mrs. Feathertop, having laid her eggs
daily with great credit to herself, notwithstanding Mrs.
Scratchard&rsquo;s predictions, began to find herself suddenly
attacked with nervous symptoms.&nbsp; She lost her gay spirits,
grew dumpish and morose, stuck up her feathers in a bristling
way, and pecked at her neighbours if they did so much as look at
her.&nbsp; Master Gray Cock was greatly concerned, and went to
old Dr. Peppercorn, who looked solemn, and recommended an
infusion of angle-worms, and said he would look in on the patient
twice a day till she was better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me, Gray Cock!&rdquo; said old Goody
Kertarkut, who had been lolling at the corner as he passed,
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you a fool?&mdash;cocks always are
fools.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know what&rsquo;s the matter with
your wife?&nbsp; She wants to sit, that&rsquo;s all; and you just
let her sit.&nbsp; A fiddlestick for Dr. Peppercorn!&nbsp; Why,
any good old hen that has brought up a family knows more than a
doctor about such things.&nbsp; You just go home and tell her to
sit if she wants to, and behave herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gray Cock came home, he found that Master Freddy had been
before him, and had established Mrs. Feathertop upon eight nice
eggs, where she was sitting in gloomy grandeur.&nbsp; He tried to
make a little affable conversation with her, and to relate his
interview with the doctor and Goody Kertarkut; but she was morose
and sullen, and only pecked at him now and then in a very sharp,
unpleasant way.&nbsp; So after a few more efforts to make himself
agreeable he left her, and went out promenading with the
captivating Mrs. Red Comb, a charming young Spanish widow, who
had just been imported into the neighbouring yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no
idea how cross my wife is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you horrid creature!&rdquo; said Mrs. Red Comb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How little you feel for the weaknesses of us poor
hens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my word, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Gray Cock,
&ldquo;you do me injustice.&nbsp; But when a hen gives way to
temper, ma&rsquo;am, and no longer meets her husband with a
smile&mdash;when she even pecks at him whom she is bound to
honour and obey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid monster! talking of obedience!&nbsp; I should
say, sir, you came straight from Turkey.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs.
Red Comb tossed her head with a most bewitching air, and
pretended to run away; and old Mrs. Scratchard looked out of her
coop and called to Goody Kertarkut,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how Mr. Gray Cock is flirting with that
widow.&nbsp; I always knew she was a baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his poor wife left at home alone,&rdquo; said Goody
Kertarkut.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way with &rsquo;em
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll know what real life is now, and she
won&rsquo;t go about holding her head so high, and looking down
on her practical neighbours that have raised families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! what&rsquo;ll she do with a family?&rdquo;
said Goody Kertarkut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what business have such young flirts to get
married?&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
expect she&rsquo;ll raise a single chick; and there&rsquo;s Gray
Cock flirting about, fine as ever.&nbsp; Folks didn&rsquo;t do so
when I was young.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure my husband knew what
treatment a sitting hen ought to have,&mdash;poor old Long Spur!
he never minded a peck or so and then.&nbsp; I must say these
modern fowls ain&rsquo;t what fowls used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the sun rose and set, and Master Fred was almost the
only friend and associate of poor little Mrs. Feathertop, whom he
fed daily with meal and water, and only interrupted her sad
reflections by pulling her up occasionally to see how the eggs
were coming on.</p>
<p>At last &ldquo;Peep, peep, peep,&rdquo; began to be heard in
the nest, and one little downy head after another poked forth
from under the feathers, surveying the world with round, bright,
winking eyes; and gradually the brood were hatched, and Mrs.
Feathertop arose, a proud and happy mother, with all the
bustling, scratching, care-taking instincts of family-life warm
within her breast.&nbsp; She clucked and scratched, and cuddled
the little downy bits of things as handily and discreetly as a
seven-year-old hen could have done, exciting thereby the wonder
of the community.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image19" href="images/p19b.jpg">
<img alt=

title=

 src="images/p19s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Master Gray Cock came home in high spirits, and complimented
her; told her she was looking charmingly once more, and said,
&ldquo;Very well, very nice,&rdquo; as he surveyed the young
brood.&nbsp; So that Mrs. Feathertop began to feel the world
going well with her, when suddenly in came Dame Scratchard and
Goody Kertarkut to make a morning call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the chicks,&rdquo; said Dame
Scratchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me,&rdquo; said Goody Kertarkut, &ldquo;what a
likeness to their dear papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but bless me, what&rsquo;s the matter with their
bills?&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my dear,
these chicks are deformed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for you, my
dear; but it&rsquo;s all the result of your inexperience.&nbsp;
You ought to have eaten pebble-stones with your meal when you
were sitting.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see, Dame Kertarkut, what
bills they have?&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll increase, and they&rsquo;ll
be frightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; said Mrs. Feathertop, now
greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, as I know of,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard,
&ldquo;since you didn&rsquo;t come to me before you sat.&nbsp; I
could have told you all about it.&nbsp; Maybe it won&rsquo;t kill
&rsquo;em, but they&rsquo;ll always be deformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the gossips departed, leaving a sting under the
pin-feathers of the poor little hen mamma, who began to see that
her darlings had curious little spoon-bills, different from her
own, and to worry and fret about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said to her spouse, &ldquo;do get
Dr. Peppercorn to come in and look at their bills, and see if
anything can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Peppercorn came in, and put on a monstrous pair of
spectacles, and said, &ldquo;Hum! ha! extraordinary case; very
singular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like it, doctor?&rdquo; said
both parents in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read of such cases.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
calcareous enlargement of the vascular bony tissue, threatening
ossification,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dreadful!&nbsp; Can it be possible?&rdquo; shrieked
both parents.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can anything be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should recommend a daily lotion made of
mosquitoes&rsquo; horns and bicarbonate of frogs&rsquo; toes,
together with a powder, to be taken morning and night, of muriate
of fleas.&nbsp; One thing you must be careful about: they must
never wet their feet, nor drink any water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, doctor, I don&rsquo;t know what I <i>shall</i>
do, for they seem to have a particular fancy for getting into
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a morbid tendency often found in these cases of
bony tumification of the vascular tissue of the mouth; but you
must resist it, ma&rsquo;am, as their life depends upon
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that Dr. Peppercorn glared gloomily on
the young ducks, who were stealthily poking the objectionable
little spoon-bills out from under their mother&rsquo;s
feathers.</p>
<p>After this poor Mrs. Feathertop led a weary life of it; for
the young fry were as healthy and enterprising a brood of young
ducks as ever carried saucepans on the end of their noses, and
they most utterly set themselves against the doctor&rsquo;s
prescriptions, murmured at the muriate of fleas and the
bicarbonate of frogs&rsquo; toes, and took every opportunity to
waddle their little ways down to the mud and water which was in
their near vicinity.&nbsp; So their bills grew larger and larger,
as did the rest of their bodies, and family government grew
weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear me out, children, you certainly
will,&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Feathertop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to destruction, do ye hear?&rdquo; said
Master Gray Cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such frights as poor Mrs. Feathertop
has got?&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew what
would come of <i>her</i> family&mdash;all deformed, and with a
dreadful sort of madness which makes them love to shovel mud with
those shocking spoon-bills of theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of idiocy,&rdquo; said Goody
Kertarkut.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor things! they can&rsquo;t be kept
from the water, nor made to take powders, and so they get worse
and worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand it&rsquo;s affecting their feet so that
they can&rsquo;t walk, and a dreadful sort of net is growing
between their toes.&nbsp; What a shocking visitation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She brought it on herself,&rdquo; said Dame
Scratchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she come to me before
she sat?&nbsp; She was always an upstart, self-conceited thing;
but I&rsquo;m sure I pity her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young ducks throve apace.&nbsp; Their necks grew
glossy, like changeable green and gold satin, and though they
would not take the doctor&rsquo;s medicine, and would waddle in
the mud and water&mdash;for which they always felt themselves to
be very naughty ducks&mdash;yet they grew quite vigorous and
hearty.&nbsp; At last one day the whole little tribe waddled off
down to the bank of the river.&nbsp; It was a beautiful day, and
the river was dancing and dimpling and winking as the little
breezes shook the trees that hung over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the biggest of the little ducks,
&ldquo;in spite of Dr. Peppercorn, I can&rsquo;t help longing for
the water.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it is going to hurt me; at
any rate, here goes,&rdquo; and in he plumped, and in went every
duck after him, and they threw out their great brown feet as
cleverly as if they had taken swimming lessons all their lives,
and sailed off on the river, away, away among the ferns, under
the pink azaleas, through reeds and rushes, and arrow-heads and
pickerel-weed, the happiest ducks that ever were born; and soon
they were quite out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Feathertop, this is a dispensation!&rdquo;
said Mrs. Scratchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your children are all drowned
at last, just as I knew they&rsquo;d be.&nbsp; The old
music-teacher, Master Bullfrog, that lives down in Water-Dock
Lane, saw &rsquo;em all plump madly into the water together this
morning.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what comes of not knowing how to
bring up a family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Feathertop gave only one shriek and fainted dead away,
and was carried home on a cabbage-leaf; and Mr. Gray Cock was
sent for, where he was waiting on Mrs. Red Comb through the
squash-vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious time in your family, sir,&rdquo;
said Goody Kertarkut, &ldquo;and you ought to be at home
supporting your wife.&nbsp; Send for Dr. Peppercorn without
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as the case was a very dreadful one, Dr. Peppercorn called
a council from the barn-yard of the squire, two miles off, and a
brisk young Dr. Partlett appeared, in a fine suit of brown and
gold, with tail-feathers like meteors.&nbsp; A fine young fellow
he was, lately from Paris, with all the modern scientific
improvements fresh in his head.</p>
<p>When he had listened to the whole story, he clapped his spur
into the ground, and leaning back laughed so loudly that all the
cocks in the neighbourhood crowed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Feathertop rose up out of her swoon, and Mr. Gray Cock
was greatly enraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir, by such behaviour in the house
of mourning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, pardon me; but there is no occasion for
mourning.&nbsp; My dear madam, let me congratulate you.&nbsp;
There is no harm done.&nbsp; The simple matter is, dear madam,
you have been under a hallucination all along.&nbsp; The
neighbourhood and my learned friend the doctor have all made a
mistake in thinking that these children of yours were hens at
all.&nbsp; They are ducks, ma&rsquo;am, evidently ducks, and very
finely-formed ducks I daresay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a quack was heard, and at a distance the whole
tribe were seen coming waddling home, their feathers gleaming in
green and gold, and they themselves in high good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a splendid day as we have had!&rdquo; they all
cried in a breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we know now how to get our
own living; we can take care of ourselves in future, so you need
have no further trouble with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the doctor, making a bow with an air
which displayed his tail-feathers to advantage, &ldquo;let me
congratulate you on the charming family you have raised.&nbsp; A
finer brood of young, healthy ducks I never saw.&nbsp; Give me
your claw, my dear friend,&rdquo; he said, addressing the eldest
son.&nbsp; &ldquo;In our barn-yard no family is more respected
than that of the ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Madam Feathertop came off glorious at last.&nbsp; And
when after this the ducks used to go swimming up and down the
river like so many nabobs among the admiring hens, Dr. Peppercorn
used to look after them and say, &ldquo;Ah, I had the care of
their infancy!&rdquo; and Mr. Gray Cock and his wife used to say,
&ldquo;It was our system of education did that!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span><i>THE
NUTCRACKERS OF NUTCRACKER LODGE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr</span>. and Mrs. Nutcracker were as
respectable a pair of squirrels as ever wore gray brushes over
their backs.&nbsp; They were animals of a settled and serious
turn of mind, not disposed to run after vanities and novelties,
but filling their station in life with prudence and
sobriety.&nbsp; Nutcracker Lodge was a hole in a sturdy old
chestnut overhanging a shady dell, and was held to be as
respectably kept an establishment as there was in the whole
forest.&nbsp; Even Miss Jenny Wren, the greatest gossip of the
neighbourhood, never found anything to criticise in its
arrangements; and old Parson Too-whit, a venerable owl who
inhabited a branch somewhat more exalted, as became his
profession, was in the habit of saving himself much trouble in
his parochial exhortations by telling his parishioners in short
to &ldquo;look at the Nutcrackers&rdquo; if they wanted to see
what it was to live a virtuous life.&nbsp; Everything had gone on
prosperously with them, and they had reared many successive
families of young Nutcrackers, who went forth to assume their
places in the forest of life, and to reflect credit on their
bringing up,&mdash;so that naturally enough they began to have a
very easy way of considering themselves models of wisdom.</p>
<p>But at last it came along, in the course of events, that they
had a son named Featherhead, who was destined to bring them a
great deal of anxiety.&nbsp; Nobody knows what the reason is, but
the fact was, that Master Featherhead was as different from all
the former children of this worthy couple as if he had been
dropped out of the moon into their nest, instead of coming into
it in the general way.&nbsp; Young Featherhead was a squirrel of
good parts and a lively disposition, but he was sulky and
contrary and unreasonable, and always finding matter of complaint
in everything his respectable papa and mamma did.&nbsp; Instead
of assisting in the cares of a family,&mdash;picking up nuts and
learning other lessons proper to a young squirrel,&mdash;he
seemed to settle himself from his earliest years into a sort of
lofty contempt for the Nutcrackers, for Nutcracker Lodge, and for
all the good old ways and institutions of the domestic hole,
which he declared to be stupid and unreasonable, and entirely
behind the times.&nbsp; To be sure, he was always on hand at
meal-times, and played a very lively tooth on the nuts which his
mother had collected, always selecting the very best for himself;
but he seasoned his nibbling with so much grumbling and
discontent, and so many severe remarks, as to give the impression
that he considered himself a peculiarly ill-used squirrel in
having to &ldquo;eat their old grub,&rdquo; as he very
unceremoniously called it.</p>
<p>Papa Nutcracker, on these occasions, was often fiercely
indignant, and poor little Mamma Nutcracker would shed tears, and
beg her darling to be a little more reasonable; but the young
gentleman seemed always to consider himself as the injured
party.</p>
<p>Now nobody could tell why or wherefore Master Featherhead
looked upon himself as injured or aggrieved, since he was living
in a good hole, with plenty to eat, and without the least care or
labour of his own; but he seemed rather to value himself upon
being gloomy and dissatisfied.&nbsp; While his parents and
brothers and sisters were cheerfully racing up and down the
branches, busy in their domestic toils, and laying up stores for
the winter, Featherhead sat gloomily apart, declaring himself
weary of existence, and feeling himself at liberty to quarrel
with everybody and everything about him.&nbsp; Nobody understood
him, he said;&mdash;he was a squirrel of a peculiar nature, and
needed peculiar treatment, and nobody treated him in a way that
did not grate on the finer nerves of his feelings.&nbsp; He had
higher notions of existence than could be bounded by that old
rotten hole in a hollow tree; he had thoughts that soared far
above the miserable, petty details of every-day life, and he
could not and would not bring down these soaring aspirations to
the contemptible toil of laying up a few chestnuts or
hickory-nuts for winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nutcracker
solemnly, &ldquo;that fellow must be a genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlestick on his genius!&rdquo; said old Mr.
Nutcracker; &ldquo;what does he <i>do</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, of course; that&rsquo;s one of the first
marks of genius.&nbsp; Geniuses, you know, never can come down to
common life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He eats enough for any two,&rdquo; remarked old
Nutcracker, &ldquo;and he never helps to gather nuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, ask Parson Too-whit.&nbsp; He has conversed
with him, and quite agrees with me that he says very uncommon
things for a squirrel of his age; he has such fine
feelings,&mdash;so much above those of the common
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine feelings be hanged!&rdquo; said old
Nutcracker.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a fellow eats all the nuts that his
mother gives him, and then grumbles at her, I don&rsquo;t believe
much in his fine feelings.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t he set himself
about something?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell my fine young
gentleman that, if he doesn&rsquo;t behave himself, I&rsquo;ll
tumble him out of the nest, neck and crop, and see if hunger
won&rsquo;t do something towards bringing down his fine
airs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then Mrs. Nutcracker fell on her husband&rsquo;s neck with
both paws, and wept, and besought him so piteously to have
patience with her darling, that old Nutcracker, who was himself a
soft-hearted old squirrel, was prevailed upon to put up with the
airs and graces of his young scapegrace a little longer; and
secretly in his silly old heart he revolved the question whether
possibly it might not be that a great genius was actually to come
of his household.</p>
<p>The Nutcrackers belonged to the old-established race of the
Grays, but they were sociable, friendly people, and kept on the
best of terms with all branches of the Nutcracker family.&nbsp;
The Chipmunks of Chipmunk Hollow were a very lively, cheerful,
sociable race, and on the very best of terms with the Nutcracker
Grays.&nbsp; Young Tip Chipmunk, the oldest son, was in all
respects a perfect contrast to Master Featherhead.&nbsp; He was
always lively and cheerful, and so very alert in providing for
the family, that old Mr. and Mrs. Chipmunk had very little care,
but could sit sociably at the door of their hole and chat with
neighbours, quite sure that Tip would bring everything out right
for them, and have plenty laid up for winter.</p>
<p>Now Featherhead took it upon him, for some reason or other, to
look down upon Tip Chipmunk, and on every occasion to disparage
him in the social circle, as a very common kind of squirrel, with
whom it would be best not to associate too freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nutcracker one day, when he
was expressing these ideas, &ldquo;it seems to me that you are
too hard on poor Tip; he is a most excellent son and brother, and
I wish you would be civil to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt that Tip is <i>good</i>
enough,&rdquo; said Featherhead carelessly; &ldquo;but then he is
so very common! he hasn&rsquo;t an idea in his skull above his
nuts and his hole.&nbsp; He is good-natured enough, to be
sure,&mdash;these very ordinary people often are
good-natured,&mdash;but he wants manner; he has really no manner
at all; and as to the deeper feelings, Tip hasn&rsquo;t the
remotest idea of them.&nbsp; I mean always to be civil to Tip
when he comes in my way, but I think the less we see of that sort
of people the better; and I hope, mother, you won&rsquo;t invite
the Chipmunks at Christmas,&mdash;these family dinners are such a
bore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, your father thinks a great deal of the
Chipmunks; and it is an old family custom to have all the
relatives here at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And an awful bore it is!&nbsp; Why must people of
refinement and elevation be forever tied down because of some
distant relationship?&nbsp; Now there are our cousins the
High-Flyers,&mdash;if we could get them, there would be some
sense in it.&nbsp; Young Whisk rather promised me for Christmas;
but it&rsquo;s seldom now you can get a flying squirrel to show
himself in our parts, and if we are intimate with the Chipmunks
it isn&rsquo;t to be expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound him for a puppy!&rdquo; said old Nutcracker,
when his wife repeated these sayings to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Featherhead is a fool.&nbsp; Common, forsooth!&nbsp; I
wish good, industrious, painstaking sons like Tip Chipmunk
<i>were</i> common.&nbsp; For my part, I find these uncommon
people the most tiresome.&nbsp; They are not content with letting
us carry the whole load, but they sit on it, and scold at us
while we carry them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But old Mr. Nutcracker, like many other good old gentlemen
squirrels, found that Christmas dinners and other things were apt
to go as his wife said, and his wife was apt to go as young
Featherhead said; and so, when Christmas came, the Chipmunks were
not invited, for the first time in many years.&nbsp; The
Chipmunks, however, took all pleasantly, and accepted poor old
Mrs. Nutcracker&rsquo;s awkward apologies with the best possible
grace; and young Tip looked in on Christmas morning with the
compliments of the season and a few beech-nuts, which he had
secured as a great dainty.&nbsp; The fact was, that Tip&rsquo;s
little striped fur coat was so filled up and overflowing with
cheerful good-will to all, that he never could be made to
understand that any of his relations could want to cut him; and
therefore Featherhead looked down on him with contempt, and said
he had no tact, and couldn&rsquo;t see when he was not
wanted.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see how, by means of persisting in remarks
like these, young Featherhead at last got all his family to look
up to him as something uncommon.&nbsp; Though he added nothing to
the family, and required more to be done for him than all the
others put together,&mdash;though he showed not the smallest real
perseverance or ability in anything useful,&mdash;yet somehow all
his brothers and sisters, and his poor foolish old mother, got
into a way of regarding him as something wonderful, and
delighting in his sharp sayings as if they had been the wisest
things in the world.</p>
<p>But at last old papa declared that it was time for Featherhead
to settle himself to some business in life, roundly declaring
that he could not always have him as a hanger-on in the paternal
hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, my boy?&rdquo; said Tip
Chipmunk to him one day.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are driving now a
thriving trade in hickory-nuts, and if you would like to join
us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Featherhead; &ldquo;but I
confess I have no fancy for anything so slow as the hickory
trade; I never was made to grub and delve in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact was that Featherhead had lately been forming
alliances such as no reputable squirrel should even think
of.&nbsp; He had more than once been seen going out evenings with
the Rats of Rat Hollow,&mdash;a race whose reputation for honesty
was more than doubtful.&nbsp; The fact was, further, that old
Longtooth Rat, an old sharper and money-lender, had long had his
eye on Featherhead as just about silly enough for their
purposes,&mdash;engaging him in what he called a speculation, but
which was neither more nor less than downright stealing.</p>
<p>Near by the chestnut-tree where Nutcracker Lodge was situated
was a large barn filled with corn and grain, besides many bushels
of hazel-nuts, chestnuts, and walnuts.&nbsp; Now old Longtooth
proposed to young Featherhead that he should nibble a passage
into this loft, and there establish himself in the commission
business, passing the nuts and corn to him as he wanted
them.&nbsp; Old Longtooth knew what he was about in the proposal,
for he had heard talk of a brisk Scotch terrier that was about to
be bought to keep the rats from the grain; but you may be sure he
kept his knowledge to himself, so that Featherhead was none the
wiser for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nonsense of fellows like Tip Chipmunk!&rdquo; said
Featherhead to his admiring brothers and sisters&mdash;&ldquo;the
perfectly stupid nonsense!&nbsp; There he goes, delving and
poking, picking up a nut here and a grain there, when <i>I</i>
step into property at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hope, my son, you are careful to be honest in
your dealings,&rdquo; said old Nutcracker, who was a very moral
squirrel.</p>
<p>With that, young Featherhead threw his tail saucily over one
shoulder, winked knowingly at his brothers, and said,
&ldquo;Certainly, sir!&nbsp; If honesty consists in getting what
you can while it is going, I mean to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon Featherhead appeared to his admiring companions in
the height of prosperity.&nbsp; He had a splendid hole in the
midst of a heap of chestnuts, and he literally seemed to be
rolling in wealth; he never came home without showering lavish
gifts on his mother and sisters; he wore his tail over his back
with a buckish air, and patronized Tip Chipmunk with a gracious
nod whenever he met him, and thought that the world was going
well with him.</p>
<p>But one luckless day, as Featherhead was lolling in his hole,
up came two boys with the friskiest, wiriest Scotch terrier you
ever saw.&nbsp; His eyes blazed like torches, and poor
Featherhead&rsquo;s heart died within him as he heard the boys
say, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t catch the
rascal that eats our grain.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Featherhead tried to slink out at the hole he had gnawed to
come in by, but found it stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are there, are you, mister?&rdquo; said the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t get out; and now for a
chase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, poor Featherhead ran distracted with terror
up and down, through the bundles of hay, between barrels, and
over casks, but with the barking terrier ever at his heels, and
the boys running, shouting, and cheering his pursuer on.&nbsp; He
was glad at last to escape through a crack, though he left half
of his fine brush behind him; for Master Wasp the terrier made a
snap at it just as he was going, and cleaned all the hair off of
it, so that it was bare as a rat&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>Poor Featherhead limped off, bruised and beaten and
bedraggled, with the boys and dog still after him; and they would
have caught him, after all, if Tip Chipmunk&rsquo;s hole had not
stood hospitably open to receive him.&nbsp; Tip took him in, like
a good-natured fellow as he was, and took the best of care of
him; but the glory of Featherhead&rsquo;s tail had departed for
ever.&nbsp; He had sprained his left paw, and got a chronic
rheumatism, and the fright and fatigue which he had gone through
had broken up his constitution, so that he never again could be
what he had been; but, Tip gave him a situation as under-clerk in
his establishment, and from that time he was a sadder and a wiser
squirrel than he ever had been before.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span><i>THE
HISTORY OF TIP-TOP</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the window of a certain
pretty little cottage there grew a great old apple-tree, which in
the spring had thousands and thousands of lovely pink blossoms on
it, and in the autumn had about half as many bright red apples as
it had blossoms in the spring.</p>
<p>The nursery of this cottage was a little bower of a room,
papered with mossy-green paper, and curtained with white muslin;
and here five little children used to come, in their white
nightgowns, to be dressed and have their hair brushed and curled
every morning.</p>
<p>First, there were Alice and Mary, bright-eyed, laughing little
girls, of seven and eight years; and then came stout little
Jamie, and Charlie; and finally little Puss, whose real name was
Ellen, but who was called Puss, and Pussy, and Birdie, and
Toddlie, and any other pet name that came to mind.</p>
<p>Now it used to happen, every morning, that the five little
heads would be peeping out of the window, together, into the
flowery boughs of the apple-tree; and the reason was this.&nbsp;
A pair of robins had built a very pretty, smooth-lined nest in a
fork of the limb that came directly under the window, and the
building of this nest had been superintended, day by day, by the
five pairs of bright eyes of these five children.&nbsp; The
robins at first had been rather shy of this inspection; but as
they got better acquainted, they seemed to think no more of the
little curly heads in the window than of the pink blossoms about
them, or the daisies and buttercups at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>All the little hands were forward to help; some threw out
flossy bits of cotton,&mdash;for which, we grieve to say, Charlie
had cut a hole in the crib quilt,&mdash;and some threw out bits
of thread and yarn, and Allie ravelled out a considerable piece
from one of her garters, which she threw out as a contribution;
and they exulted in seeing the skill with which the little
builders wove everything in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little birds, little
birds,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;you shall be kept warm, for
we have given you cotton out of our crib quilt, and yarn out of
our stockings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, so far did this generosity
proceed, that Charlie cut a flossy, golden curl from
Toddlie&rsquo;s head and threw it out; and when the birds caught
it up the whole flock laughed to see Toddlie&rsquo;s golden hair
figuring in a bird&rsquo;s-nest.</p>
<p>When the little thing was finished, it was so neat, and trim,
and workman-like, that the children all exulted over it, and
called it &ldquo;our nest,&rdquo; and the two robins they called
&ldquo;our birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; But wonderful was the joy when the
little eyes, opening one morning, saw in the nest a beautiful
pale-green egg; and the joy grew from day to day, for every day
there came another egg, and so on till there were five little
eggs; and then the oldest girl, Alice, said, &ldquo;There are
five eggs: that makes one for each of us, and each of us will
have a little bird by-and-by;&rdquo;&mdash;at which all the
children laughed and jumped for glee.</p>
<p>When the five little eggs were all laid, the mother-bird began
to sit on them; and at any time of day or night, when a little
head peeped out of the nursery window, might be seen a round,
bright, patient pair of bird&rsquo;s eyes contentedly waiting for
the young birds to come.&nbsp; It seemed a long time for the
children to wait; but every day they put some bread and cake from
their luncheon on the window-sill, so that the birds might have
something to eat; but still there she was, patiently sitting!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image47" href="images/p47b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;How long, long, long she waits!&rdquo; said Jamie
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s ever
going to hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes she is!&rdquo; said grave little Alice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jamie, you don&rsquo;t understand about these things; it
takes a long, long time to hatch eggs.&nbsp; Old Sam says his
hens sit three weeks;&mdash;only think, almost a
month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three weeks looked a long time to the five bright pairs of
little watching eyes; but Jamie said the eggs were so much
smaller than hens&rsquo; eggs that it wouldn&rsquo;t take so long
to hatch them, he knew.&nbsp; Jamie always thought he knew all
about everything, and was so sure of it that he rather took the
lead among the children.&nbsp; But one morning, when they pushed
their five heads out of the window, the round, patient little
bird-eyes were gone, and there seemed to be nothing in the nest
but a bunch of something hairy.</p>
<p>Upon this they all cried out, &ldquo;O mamma, <i>do</i> come
here! the bird is gone and left her nest?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when
they cried out, they saw five wide little red mouths open in the
nest, and saw that the hairy bunch of stuff was indeed the first
of five little birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dreadful-looking things,&rdquo; said Mary;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that little birds began by looking so
badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be all mouth,&rdquo; said Jamie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must feed them,&rdquo; said
Charlie.&mdash;&ldquo;Here, little birds, here&rsquo;s some
gingerbread for you,&rdquo; he said; and he threw a bit of his
gingerbread, which fortunately only hit the nest on the outside,
and fell down among the buttercups, where two crickets made a
meal of it, and agreed that it was as excellent gingerbread as if
old Mother Cricket herself had made it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, Charlie,&rdquo; said his mamma; &ldquo;we do
not know enough to feed young birds.&nbsp; We must leave that to
their papa and mamma, who probably started out bright and early
in the morning to get breakfast for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, while they were speaking, back came Mr. and Mrs.
Robin, whirring through the green shadows of the apple tree; and
thereupon all the five little red mouths flew open, and the birds
put something into each.</p>
<p>It was great amusement, after this, to watch the daily feeding
of the little birds, and to observe how, when not feeding them,
the mother sat brooding on the nest, warming them under her soft
wings, while the father-bird sat on the topmost bough of the
apple-tree and sang to them.&nbsp; In time they grew and grew,
and, instead of a nest full of little red mouths, there was a
nest full of little, fat, speckled robins, with round, bright,
cunning eyes, just like their parents; and the children began to
talk together about their birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give my robin a name,&rdquo; said
Mary.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call him Brown-Eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I call mine Tip-Top,&rdquo; said Jamie,
&ldquo;because I know he&rsquo;ll be a tip-top bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I call mine Singer,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;all mine Toddy,&rdquo; said little Toddlie,
who would not be behindhand in anything that was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Toddlie!&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;hers is
the best of all.&nbsp; For my part, I call mine
Speckle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So then the birds were all made separate characters by having
each a separate name given it.</p>
<p>Brown-Eyes, Tip-Top, Singer, Toddy, and Speckle made, as they
grew bigger, a very crowded nestful of birds.</p>
<p>Now the children had early been taught to say in a little
hymn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Birds in their little nests agree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis a shameful sight<br />
When children of one family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall out, and chide, and fight;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and they thought anything really written and printed in a hymn
must be true; therefore they were very much astonished to see,
from day to day, that <i>their</i> little birds in their nest did
<i>not</i> agree.</p>
<p>Tip-Top was the biggest and strongest bird, and he was always
shuffling and crowding the others, and clamouring for the most
food; and when Mrs. Robin came in with a nice bit of anything,
Tip-Top&rsquo;s red mouth opened so wide, and he was so noisy,
that one would think the nest was all his.&nbsp; His mother used
to correct him for these gluttonous ways, and sometimes made him
wait till all the rest were helped before she gave him a
mouthful; but he generally revenged himself in her absence by
crowding the others and making the nest generally
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Speckle, however, was a bird of spirit, and
he used to peck at Tip-Top; so they would sometimes have a
regular sparring-match across poor Brown-Eyes, who was a meek,
tender little fellow, and would sit winking and blinking in fear
while his big brothers quarrelled.&nbsp; As to Toddy and Singer,
they turned out to be sister birds, and showed quite a feminine
talent for chattering; they used to scold their badly behaving
brothers in a way that made the nest quite lively.</p>
<p>On the whole Mr. and Mrs. Robin did not find their family
circle the peaceable place the poet represents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Tip-Top one day to them, &ldquo;this
old nest is a dull, mean, crowded hole, and it&rsquo;s quite time
some of us were out of it.&nbsp; Just give us lessons in flying,
won&rsquo;t you? and let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Mother Robin, &ldquo;we shall
teach you to fly as soon as your wings are strong
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very little bird,&rdquo; said his father,
&ldquo;and ought to be good and obedient, and wait patiently till
your wing-feathers grow; and then you can soar away to some
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for my wing-feathers?&nbsp; Humbug!&rdquo; Tip-Top
would say, as he sat balancing with his little short tail on the
edge of the nest, and looking down through the grass and
clover-heads below, and up into the blue clouds above.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Father and mother are slow old birds; they keep a fellow
back with their confounded notions.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t
hurry up, I&rsquo;ll take matters into my own claws, and be off
some day before they know it.&nbsp; Look at those swallows,
skimming and diving through the blue air!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way I want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear brother, the way to learn to do that is to be
good and obedient while we are little, and wait till our parents
think it best for us to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up your preaching,&rdquo; said Tip-Top;
&ldquo;what do you girls know of flying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About as much as you,&rdquo; said Speckle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care how soon you
take yourself off, for you take up more room than all the rest
put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mind yourself, Master Speckle, or you&rsquo;ll get
something you don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; said Tip-Top, still
strutting in a very cavalier way on the edge of the nest, and
sticking up his little short tail quite valiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my darlings,&rdquo; said their mamma, now fluttering
home, &ldquo;cannot I ever teach you to live in love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Tip-Top&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; screamed
the other birds in a flutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault?&nbsp; Of course, everything in this nest that
goes wrong is laid to me,&rdquo; said Tip-Top; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll leave it to anybody, now, if I crowd anybody.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been sitting outside, on the very edge of the nest,
and there&rsquo;s Speckle has got my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants your place?&rdquo; said Speckle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can come in, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;do go into
the nest and be a good little bird, and then you will be
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the talk,&rdquo; said
Tip-Top.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too big for the nest, and I want
to see the world.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of beautiful things, I
know.&nbsp; Now there&rsquo;s the most lovely creature, with
bright eyes, that comes under the tree every day, and wants me to
come down in the grass and play with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, my son, beware!&rdquo; said the frightened
mother; &ldquo;that lovely-seeming creature is our dreadful
enemy, the cat,&mdash;a horrid monster, with teeth and
claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, all the little birds shuddered and cuddled deeper in
the nest; only Tip-Top in his heart disbelieved it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old a bird,&rdquo; said he to himself,
&ldquo;to believe <i>that</i> story; mother is chaffing me.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll show her that I can take care of
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next morning, after the father and mother were gone,
Tip-Top got on the edge of the nest again, and looked over and
saw lovely Miss Pussy washing her face among the daisies under
the tree, and her hair was sleek and white as the daisies, and
her eyes were yellow and beautiful to behold, and she looked up
to the tree bewitchingly, and said, &ldquo;Little birds, little
birds, come down; Pussy wants to play with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only look at her!&rdquo; said Tip-Top; &ldquo;her eyes
are like gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t look,&rdquo; said Singer and
Speckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will bewitch you, and then eat you
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see her try to eat me up,&rdquo; said
Tip-Top, again balancing his short tail over the nest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just as if she would.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s just the nicest,
most innocent creature going, and only wants us to have
fun.&nbsp; We never do have any fun in this old nest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the yellow eyes below shot a bewildering light into
Tip-Top&rsquo;s eyes, and a voice sounded sweet as silver:
&ldquo;Little birds, little birds, come down; Pussy wants to play
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her paws are as white as velvet,&rdquo; said Tip-Top,
&ldquo;and so soft!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe she has any
claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, brother, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; screamed
both sisters.</p>
<p>All we know about it is, that a moment after a direful scream
was heard from the nursery window.&nbsp; &ldquo;O mamma, mamma,
do come here!&nbsp; Tip-Top&rsquo;s fallen out of the nest, and
the cat has got him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away ran Pussy with foolish little Tip-Top in her mouth, and
he squeaked dolefully when he felt her sharp teeth.&nbsp; Wicked
Miss Pussy had no mind to eat him at once; she meant just as she
said, to &ldquo;play with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she ran off to a
private place among the currant-bushes, while all the little
curly heads were scattered up and down looking for her.</p>
<p>Did you ever see a cat play with a bird or a mouse?&nbsp; She
sets it down, and seems to go off and leave it; but the moment it
makes the first movement to get away,&mdash;pounce! she springs
on it, and shakes it in her mouth; and so she teases and
tantalizes it, till she gets ready to kill and eat it.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t say why she does it, except that it is a cat&rsquo;s
nature; and it is a very bad nature for foolish young robins to
get acquainted with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where is he? where is he?&nbsp; Do find my poor
Tip-Top,&rdquo; said Jamie, crying as loud as he could
scream.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill that horrid
cat,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill her!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Robin, who had come home meantime, joined their
plaintive chirping to the general confusion; and Mrs.
Robin&rsquo;s bright eyes soon discovered her poor little son,
where Pussy was patting and rolling him from one paw to the other
under the currant-bushes; and settling on the bush above, she
called the little folks to the spot by her cries.</p>
<p>Jamie plunged under the bush, and caught the cat with luckless
Tip-Top in her mouth; and, with one or two good thumps, he
obliged her to let him go.&nbsp; Tip-Top was not dead, but in a
sadly draggled and torn state.&nbsp; Some of his feathers were
torn out, and one of his wings was broken, and hung down in a
melancholy way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what <i>shall</i> we do for him?&nbsp; He will
die.&nbsp; Poor Tip-Top!&rdquo; said the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put him back into the nest,
children,&rdquo; said mamma.&nbsp; &ldquo;His mother will know
best what to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a ladder was got, and papa climbed up and put poor Tip-Top
safely into the nest.&nbsp; The cat had shaken all the nonsense
well out of him; he was a dreadfully humbled young robin.</p>
<p>The time came at last when all the other birds in the nest
learned to fly, and fluttered and flew about everywhere; but poor
melancholy Tip-Top was still confined to the nest with a broken
wing.&nbsp; Finally, <i>as</i> it became evident that it would be
long before he could fly, Jamie took him out of the nest, and
made a nice little cage for him, and used to feed him every day,
and he would hop about and seem tolerably contented; but it was
evident that he would be a lame-winged robin all his days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image59" href="images/p59b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Jamie&rsquo;s mother told him that Tip-Top&rsquo;s history was
an allegory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, mamma,&rdquo; said
Jamie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When something in a bird&rsquo;s life is like something
in a boy&rsquo;s life, or when a story is similar in its meaning
to reality, we call it an allegory.&nbsp; Little boys, when they
are about half grown up, sometimes do just as Tip-Top did.&nbsp;
They are in a great hurry to get away from home into the great
world; and then temptation comes, with bright eyes and smooth
velvet paws, and promises them fun; and they go to bad places;
they get to smoking, and then to drinking; and, finally, the bad
habit gets them in its teeth and claws, and plays with them as a
cat does with a mouse.&nbsp; They try to reform, just as your
robin tried to get away from the cat; but their bad habits pounce
on them and drag them back.&nbsp; And so, when the time comes
that they want to begin life, they are miserable, broken-down
creatures, like your broken-winged robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Jamie, remember, and don&rsquo;t try to be a man
before your time, and let your parents judge for you while you
are young; and never believe in any soft white Pussy, with golden
eyes, that comes and wants to tempt you to come down and play
with her.&nbsp; If a big boy offers to teach you to smoke a
cigar, that is Pussy.&nbsp; If a boy wants you to go into a
billiard-saloon, that is Pussy.&nbsp; If a boy wants you to learn
to drink anything with spirit in it, however sweetened and
disguised, remember Pussy is there.&nbsp; And Pussy&rsquo;s claws
are long, and Pussy&rsquo;s teeth are strong; and if she gives
you one shake in your youth, you will be like a broken-winged
robin all your days.&rdquo;</p>

61</span><i>MISS KATY-DID AND MISS CRICKET</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Katy-did</span> sat on the branch of
a flowering azalea, in her best suit of fine green and silver,
with wings of point-lace from Mother Nature&rsquo;s finest
web.</p>
<p>Miss Katy was in the very highest possible spirits, because
her gallant cousin, Colonel Katy-did, had looked in to make her a
morning visit.&nbsp; It was a fine morning, too, which goes for
as much among the Katy-dids as among men and women.&nbsp; It was,
in fact, a morning that Miss Katy thought must have been made on
purpose for her to enjoy herself in.&nbsp; There had been a
patter of rain the night before, which had kept the leaves awake
talking to each other till nearly morning; but by dawn the small
winds had blown brisk little puffs, and whisked the heavens clear
and bright with their tiny wings, as you have seen Susan clear
away the cobwebs in your mamma&rsquo;s parlour; and so now there
were only left a thousand blinking, burning water-drops, hanging
like convex mirrors at the end of each leaf, and Miss Katy
admired herself in each one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I am a pretty creature,&rdquo; she said to
herself; and when the gallant colonel said something about being
dazzled by her beauty, she only tossed her head and took it as
quite a matter of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, my dear colonel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
am thinking of giving a party, and you must help me to make out
the lists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you make me the happiest of
Katy-dids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Miss Katy-did, drawing an azalea-leaf
towards her, &ldquo;let us see&mdash;whom shall we have?&nbsp;
The Fireflies, of course; everybody wants them, they are so
brilliant,&mdash;a little unsteady, to be sure, but quite in the
higher circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must have the Fireflies,&rdquo; echoed the
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, and the Butterflies and the Moths.&nbsp;
Now, there&rsquo;s a trouble.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s such an
everlasting tribe of those Moths; and if you invite dull people
they&rsquo;re always sure all to come, every one of them.&nbsp;
Still, if you have the Butterflies, you can&rsquo;t leave out the
Moths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Mrs. Moth has been laid up lately with a gastric
fever, and that may keep two or three of the Misses Moth at
home,&rdquo; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever could give the old lady such a turn?&rdquo;
said Miss Katy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought she never was
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect it&rsquo;s high living.&nbsp; I understand
she and her family ate up a whole ermine cape last month, and it
disagreed with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, I can&rsquo;t conceive how the Moths can
live as they do,&rdquo; said Miss Katy, with a face of
disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I could no more eat worsted and fur,
as they do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite evident from the fairy-like delicacy of
your appearance,&rdquo; said the colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can
see that nothing so gross or material has ever entered into your
system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Miss Katy, &ldquo;mamma
says she don&rsquo;t know what does keep me alive; half a dewdrop
and a little bit of the nicest part of a rose-leaf, I assure you,
often last me for a day.&nbsp; But we are forgetting our
list.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;the Fireflies, Butterflies,
Moths.&nbsp; The Bees must come, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bees are a worthy family,&rdquo; said the
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy enough, but dreadfully humdrum,&rdquo; said Miss
Katy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They never talk about anything but honey and
housekeeping; still, they are a class of people one cannot
neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there are the Bumble-Bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dote on them!&nbsp; General Bumble is one of the
most dashing, brilliant fellows of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is shockingly corpulent,&rdquo; said Colonel
Katy-did, not at all pleased to hear him praised;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but he <i>is</i> a little
stout,&rdquo; said Miss Katy; &ldquo;but so distinguished and
elegant in his manners&mdash;something quite martial and breezy
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you invite the Bumble-Bees, you must have the
Hornets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those spiteful Hornets!&nbsp; I detest them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, dear Miss Katy, one does not like to
offend the Hornets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, one can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There are those five Misses
Hornet&mdash;dreadful old maids!&mdash;as full of spite as they
can live.&nbsp; You may be sure they will every one come, and be
looking about to make spiteful remarks.&nbsp; Put down the
Hornets, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Mosquitoes!&rdquo; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those horrid Mosquitoes&mdash;they are dreadfully
plebeian!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t one cut them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well dear Miss Katy,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;if
you ask my candid opinion as a friend, I should say not.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s young Mosquito, who graduated last year, has gone
into literature, and is connected with some of our leading
papers, and they say he carries the sharpest pen of all the
writers.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t do to offend him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I suppose we must have his old aunts, and all
six of his sisters, and all his dreadfully common
relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;but one
must pay one&rsquo;s tax to society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this moment the conference was interrupted by a
visitor, Miss Keziah Cricket, who came in with her work-bag on
her arm to ask a subscription for a poor family of Ants who had
just had their house hoed up in clearing the garden-walks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of them,&rdquo; said Katy, &ldquo;not to
know better than to put their house in the garden-walk;
that&rsquo;s just like those Ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are in great trouble; all their stores
destroyed, and their father killed&mdash;cut quite in two by a
hoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very shocking!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like to hear of
such disagreeable things; it affects my nerves terribly.&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t anything to give.&nbsp;
Mamma said yesterday she was sure she didn&rsquo;t know how our
bills were to be paid; and there&rsquo;s my green satin with
point-lace yet to come home.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Miss Katy-did
shrugged her shoulders and affected to be very busy with Colonel
Katy-did, in just the way that young ladies sometimes do when
they wish to signify to visitors that they had better leave.</p>
<p>Little Miss Cricket perceived how the case stood, and so
hopped briskly off, without giving herself even time to be
offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor extravagant little thing!&rdquo; said
she to herself, &ldquo;it was hardly worth while to ask
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, shall you invite the Crickets?&rdquo; said
Colonel Katy-did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; I?&nbsp; Why, colonel, what a
question!&nbsp; Invite the Crickets?&nbsp; Of what can you be
thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you not ask the Locusts, and the
Grasshoppers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; The Locusts, of course,&mdash;a very
old and distinguished family; and the Grasshoppers are pretty
well, and ought to be asked.&nbsp; But we must draw a line
somewhere,&mdash;and the Crickets! why, it&rsquo;s shocking even
to think of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they were nice, respectable
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, perfectly nice and respectable,&mdash;very good
people, in fact, so far as that goes.&nbsp; But then you must see
the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear cousin, I am afraid you must
explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, their <i>colour</i>, to be sure.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it, is it?&nbsp; Excuse me, but I have been living in France,
where these distinctions are wholly unknown, and I have not yet
got myself in the train of fashionable ideas here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let me teach you,&rdquo; said Miss
Katy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know we republicans go for no distinctions
except those created by Nature herself, and we found our rank
upon <i>colour</i>, because that is clearly a thing that none has
any hand in but our Maker.&nbsp; You see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but who decides what colour shall be the reigning
colour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised to hear the question!&nbsp; The
only true colour&mdash;the only proper one&mdash;is <i>our</i>
colour, to be sure.&nbsp; A lovely pea-green is the precise shade
on which to found aristocratic distinction.&nbsp; But then we are
liberal;&mdash;we associate with the Moths, who are gray; with
the Butterflies, who are blue-and-gold coloured; with the
Grasshoppers, yellow and brown; and society would become
dreadfully mixed if it were not fortunately ordered that the
Crickets are black as jet.&nbsp; The fact is, that a class to be
looked down upon is necessary to all elegant society; and if the
Crickets were not black, we could not keep them down, because, as
everybody knows, they are often a great deal cleverer than we
are.&nbsp; They have a vast talent for music and dancing; they
are very quick at learning, and would be getting to the very top
of the ladder if we once allowed them to climb.&nbsp; But their
being black is a convenience; because, as long as we are green
and they black, we have a superiority that can never be taken
from us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I see exactly,&rdquo; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Keziah Cricket, who just came in here, is
quite a musician, and her old father plays the violin
beautifully;&mdash;by the way, we might engage him for our
orchestra.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And so Miss Katy&rsquo;s ball came off, and the performers
kept it up from sundown till daybreak, so that it seemed as if
every leaf in the forest were alive.&nbsp; The Katy-dids and the
Mosquitoes, and the Locusts, and a full orchestra of Crickets
made the air perfectly vibrate, insomuch that old Parson
Too-Whit, who was preaching a Thursday evening lecture to a very
small audience, announced to his hearers that he should certainly
write a discourse against dancing for the next weekly
occasion.</p>
<p>The good doctor was even with his word in the matter, and gave
out some very sonorous discourses, without in the least stopping
the round of gaieties kept up by these dissipated Katy-dids,
which ran on, night after night, till the celebrated Jack Frost
epidemic, which occurred somewhere about the first of
September.</p>
<p>Poor Miss Katy, with her flimsy green satin and point-lace,
was one of the first victims, and fell from the bough in company
with a sad shower of last year&rsquo;s leaves.&nbsp; The worthy
Cricket family, however, avoided Jack Frost by emigrating in time
to the chimney-corner of a nice little cottage that had been
built in the wood that summer.</p>
<p>There good old Mr. and Mrs. Cricket, with sprightly Miss
Keziah and her brothers and sisters, found a warm and welcome
home; and when the storm howled without, and lashed the poor
naked trees, the Crickets on the warm hearth would chirp out
cheery welcome to papa as he came in from the snowy path, or
mamma as she sat at her work-basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep, cheep!&rdquo; little Freddy would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma, who is it says
&lsquo;cheep&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Freddy, it&rsquo;s our own dear little cricket,
who loves us and comes to sing to us when the snow is on the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when poor Miss Katy-did&rsquo;s satin and lace were all
swept away, the warm home-talents of the Crickets made for them a
welcome refuge.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span><i>MOTHER MAGPIE&rsquo;S MISCHIEF</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mother Magpie was about the
busiest character in the forest.&nbsp; But you must know that
there is a great difference between being busy and being
industrious.&nbsp; One may be very busy all the time, and yet not
in the least industrious; and this was the case with Mother
Magpie.</p>
<p>She was always full of everybody&rsquo;s business but her
own&mdash;up and down, here and there, everywhere but in her own
nest, knowing everyone&rsquo;s affairs, telling what everybody
had been doing or ought to do, and ready to cast her advice
<i>gratis</i> at every bird and beast of the woods.</p>
<p>Now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the
oak-tree, to tell old Parson Too-Whit what she thought he ought
to preach for his next sermon, and how dreadful the morals of the
parish were becoming.&nbsp; Then, having perfectly bewildered the
poor old gentleman, who was always sleepy of a Monday morning,
Mother Magpie would take a peep into Mrs. Oriole&rsquo;s nest,
sit chattering on a bough above, and pour forth floods of advice,
which, poor little Mrs. Oriole used to say to her husband,
bewildered her more than a hard north-east storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear,&rdquo; Mother Magpie would
say, &ldquo;that this way of building your nest, swinging like an
old empty stocking from a bough, isn&rsquo;t at all the
thing.&nbsp; I never built one so in my life, and I never have
headaches.&nbsp; Now you complain always that your head aches
whenever I call upon you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all on account of this
way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; piped Mrs. Oriole timidly,
&ldquo;the Orioles always have built in this manner, and it suits
our constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fiddle on your constitution!&nbsp; How can you tell
what agrees with your constitution unless you try?&nbsp; You own
you are not well; you are subject to headaches; and every
physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the
stomach and acts upon the brain.&nbsp; Ask old Dr. Kite.&nbsp; I
was talking with him about your case only yesterday, and says he,
&lsquo;Mrs. Magpie, I perfectly agree with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my husband prefers this style of
building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only because he isn&rsquo;t properly
instructed.&nbsp; Pray, did you ever attend Dr. Kite&rsquo;s
lectures on the nervous system?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have no time to attend lectures.&nbsp; Who would
sit on the eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your husband, to be sure; don&rsquo;t he take his
turn in sitting?&nbsp; If he don&rsquo;t, he ought to.&nbsp; I
shall speak to him about it.&nbsp; My husband always sits
regularly half the time, that I may have time to go about and
exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mrs. Magpie, pray don&rsquo;t speak to my husband; he
will think I&rsquo;ve been complaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, he won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Let me alone.&nbsp; I
understand just how to say the thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve advised
hundreds of young husbands in my day, and I never gave
offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you, Mrs. Magpie, I don&rsquo;t want any
interference between my husband and me, and I will not have
it,&rdquo; says Mrs. Oriole, with her little round eyes flashing
with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself in a passion, my dear; the
more you talk, the more sure I am that your nervous system is
running down, or you wouldn&rsquo;t forget good manners in this
way.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better take my advice, for I understand
just what to do,&rdquo;&mdash;and away sails Mother Magpie; and
presently young Oriole comes home all in a flutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, my dear, if you will persist in gossiping over
our private family matters with that old Mother
Magpie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I don&rsquo;t gossip.&nbsp; She comes and
bores me to death with talking, and then goes off and mistakes
what she has been saying for what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must <i>cut</i> her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to, all I can; but she won&rsquo;t <i>be</i>
cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to make a bird swear,&rdquo; said
Tommy Oriole.</p>
<p>Tommy Oriole, to say the truth, had as good a heart as ever
beat under bird&rsquo;s feathers; but then he had a weakness for
concerts and general society, because he was held to be, by all
odds, the handsomest bird in the woods, and sung like an angel;
and so the truth was he didn&rsquo;t confine himself so much to
the domestic nest as Tom Titmouse or Billy Wren.&nbsp; But he
determined that he wouldn&rsquo;t have old Mother Magpie
interfering with his affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; quoth Tommy, &ldquo;I am a society
bird, and Nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range
of the commonplace, and my wife must learn to accommodate.&nbsp;
If she has a brilliant husband, whose success gratifies her
ambition and places her in a distinguished public position, she
must pay something for it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Billy
Wren&rsquo;s wife would give her very bill to see her husband in
the circles where I am quite at home.&nbsp; To say the truth, my
wife was all well enough content till old Mother Magpie
interfered.&nbsp; It is quite my duty to take strong ground, and
show that I cannot be dictated to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after this, Tommy Oriole went to rather more concerts, and
spent less time at home than ever he did before, which was all
that Mother Magpie effected in that quarter.&nbsp; I confess this
was very bad in Tommy; but then birds are no better than men in
domestic matters, and sometimes will take the most unreasonable
courses, if a meddlesome Magpie gets her claw into their
nest.</p>
<p>But old Mother Magpie had now got a new business in hand in
another quarter.&nbsp; She bustled off down to Water-Dock Lane,
where, as we said in a former narrative, lived the old
music-teacher, Dr. Bullfrog.&nbsp; The poor old doctor was a
simple-minded, good, amiable creature, who had played the
double-bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions
since nobody knows when.&nbsp; Latterly some youngsters had
arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age.&nbsp;
In fact, since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the
forest, tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and
quiet habits which old Mother Nature had always kept up in those
parts.&nbsp; They pulled the young checkerberry before it even
had time to blossom, rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed
their roots, fired off guns at the birds, and on several
occasions, when old Dr. Bullfrog was leading a concert, had
dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones.</p>
<p>This was not the worst of it.&nbsp; The little varlets had a
way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts, and
mimicking the tones of his bass-viol.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you go,
Paddy-go-donk, Paddy-go-donk&mdash;umph&mdash;chunk,&rdquo; some
rascal of a boy would shout, while poor old Bullfrog&rsquo;s
yellow spectacles would be bedewed with tears of honest
indignation.&nbsp; In time, the jeers of these little savages
began to tell on the society in the forest, and to corrupt their
simple manners; and it was whispered among the younger and more
heavy birds and squirrels that old Bullfrog was a bore, and that
it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish, and to
give the charge of it to some more modern performer.</p>
<p>Poor old Dr. Bullfrog knew nothing of this, however, and was
doing his simple best, in peace, when Mother Magpie called in
upon him one morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, neighbour, how unreasonable people are!&nbsp; Who
would have thought that the youth of our generation should have
no more consideration for established merit?&nbsp; Now, for my
part, <i>I</i> think your music-teaching never was better; and as
for our choir, I maintain constantly that it never was in better
order, but&mdash;Well, one may wear her tongue out, but one can
never make these young folks listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said poor Dr. Bullfrog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you haven&rsquo;t heard of a committee that is
going to call on you, to ask you to resign the care of the parish
music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dr. Bullfrog, with all that energy
of tone for which he was remarkable, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
it,&mdash;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> believe it.&nbsp; You must have
made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mistake!&nbsp; No, no, my good friend; I never make
mistakes.&nbsp; What I know, I know certainly.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
it I that said I knew there was an engagement between Tim
Chipmunk and Nancy Nibble, who are married this very day?&nbsp; I
knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts;
and I can tell you, you are going to be scandalously and
ungratefully treated, Dr. Bullfrog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, we shall all be ruined!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bullfrog; &ldquo;my poor husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, if you take things in time, and listen
to my advice,&rdquo; said Mother Magpie, &ldquo;we may yet pull
you through.&nbsp; You must alter your style a
little,&mdash;adapt it to modern times.&nbsp; Everybody now is a
little touched with the operatic fever, and there&rsquo;s Tommy
Oriole has been to New Orleans and brought back a touch of the
artistic.&nbsp; If you would try his style a
little,&mdash;something Tyrolean, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, consider my voice.&nbsp; I never could hit
the high notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all practice; Tommy
Oriole says so.&nbsp; Just try the scales.&nbsp; As to your
voice, your manner of living has a great deal to do with
it.&nbsp; I always did tell you that your passion for water
injured your singing.&nbsp; Suppose Tommy Oriole should sit half
his days up to his hips in water, as you do,&mdash;his voice
would be as hoarse and rough as yours.&nbsp; Come up on the bank
and learn to perch, as we birds do.&nbsp; We are the true musical
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so poor Mr. Bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant
little cottage under the cat-tails, where his green spectacles
and honest round back had excited, even in the minds of the boys,
sentiments of respect and compassion.&nbsp; He came up into the
garden, and established himself under a burdock, and began to
practise Italian scales.</p>
<p>The result was, that poor old Dr. Bullfrog, instead of being
considered as a respectable old bore, got himself universally
laughed at for aping fashionable manners.&nbsp; Every bird and
beast in the forest had a gibe at him; and even old Parson
Too-Whit thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call,
and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and
standing.&nbsp; As to Mother Magpie, you may be sure that she
assured every one how sorry she was that dear old Dr. Bullfrog
had made such a fool of himself; if he had taken her advice, he
would have kept on respectably as a nice old Bullfrog should.</p>
<p>But the tragedy for the poor old music-teacher grew even more
melancholy in its termination; for one day, as he was sitting
disconsolately under a currant-bush in the garden, practising his
poor old notes in a quiet way, <i>thump</i> came a great blow of
a hoe, which nearly broke his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! what ugly beast have we got here?&rdquo; said
Tom Noakes, the gardener&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, here,
Wasp, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a fright for a poor, quiet, old Bullfrog, as little wiry,
wicked Wasp came at him, barking and yelping.&nbsp; He jumped
with all his force sheer over a patch of bushes into the river,
and swam back to his old home among the cat-tails.&nbsp; And
always after that it was observable that he was very
low-spirited, and took very dark views of life; but nothing made
him so angry as any allusion to Mother Magpie, of whom, from that
time, he never spoke except as <i>Old Mother Mischief</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span><i>THE
SQUIRRELS THAT LIVE IN A HOUSE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a gentleman went
out into a great forest, and cut away the trees, and built there
a very nice little cottage.&nbsp; It was set very low on the
ground, and had very large bow-windows, and so much of it was
glass that one could look through it on every side and see what
was going on in the forest.&nbsp; You could see the shadows of
the fern-leaves, as they flickered and wavered over the ground,
and the scarlet partridge-berry and winter-green plums that
matted round the roots of the trees, and the bright spots of
sunshine that fell through their branches and went dancing about
among the bushes and leaves at their roots.&nbsp; You could see
the chirping sparrows and the thrushes and robins and bluebirds
building their nests here and there among the branches, and watch
them from day to day as they laid their eggs and hatched their
young.&nbsp; You could also see red squirrels, and gray
squirrels, and little striped chip-squirrels, darting and
springing about, here and there and everywhere, running races
with each other from bough to bough, and chattering at each other
in the gayest possible manner.</p>
<p>You may be sure that such a strange thing as a house for human
beings to live in did not come into this wild wood without making
quite a stir and excitement among the inhabitants that lived
there before.&nbsp; All the time it was building, there was the
greatest possible commotion in the breasts of all the older
population; and there wasn&rsquo;t even a black ant, or a
cricket, that did not have his own opinion about it, and did not
tell the other ants and crickets just what he thought the world
was coming to in consequence.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Rabbit declared that the hammering and pounding made
her nervous, and gave her most melancholy forebodings of evil
times.&nbsp; &ldquo;Depend upon it, children,&rdquo; she said to
her long-eared family, &ldquo;no good will come to us from this
establishment.&nbsp; Where man is, there comes always trouble for
us poor rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old chestnut-tree, that grew on the edge of the woodland
ravine, drew a great sigh which shook all his leaves, and
expressed it as his conviction that no good would ever come of
it,&mdash;a conviction that at once struck to the heart of every
chestnut-burr.&nbsp; The squirrels talked together of the
dreadful state of things that would ensue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; said old Father Gray, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
evident that Nature made the nuts for us; but one of these great
human creatures will carry off and gormandize upon what would
keep a hundred poor families of squirrels in
comfort.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Ground-mole said it did not require
very sharp eyes to see into the future, and it would just end in
bringing down the price of real estate in the whole vicinity, so
that every decent-minded and respectable quadruped would be
obliged to move away;&mdash;for his part, he was ready to sell
out for anything he could get.&nbsp; The bluebirds and bobolinks,
it is true, took more cheerful views of matters; but then, as old
Mrs. Ground-mole observed, they were a flighty set,&mdash;half
their time careering and dissipating in the Southern
States,&mdash;and could not be expected to have that patriotic
attachment to their native soil that those had who had grubbed in
it from their earliest days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This race of man,&rdquo; said the old chestnut-tree,
&ldquo;is never ceasing in its restless warfare on Nature.&nbsp;
In our forest solitudes hitherto how peacefully, how quietly, how
regularly has everything gone on!&nbsp; Not a flower has missed
its appointed time of blossoming, or failed to perfect its
fruit.&nbsp; No matter how hard has been the winter, how loud the
winds have roared, and how high the snow-banks have been piled,
all has come right again in spring.&nbsp; Not the least root has
lost itself under the snows, so as not to be ready with its fresh
leaves and blossoms when the sun returns to melt the frosty
chains of winter.&nbsp; We have storms sometimes that threaten to
shake everything to pieces,&mdash;the thunder roars, the
lightning flashes, and the winds howl and beat; but, when all is
past, everything comes out better and brighter than
before,&mdash;not a bird is killed, not the frailest flower
destroyed.&nbsp; But man comes, and in one day he will make a
desolation that centuries cannot repair.&nbsp; Ignorant boor that
he is, and all incapable of appreciating the glorious works of
Nature, it seems to be his glory to be able to destroy in a few
hours what it was the work of ages to produce.&nbsp; The noble
oak, that has been cut away to build this contemptible human
dwelling, had a life older and wiser than that of any man in this
country.&nbsp; That tree has seen generations of men come and
go.&nbsp; It was a fresh young tree when Shakespeare was born; it
was hardly a middle-aged tree when he died; it was growing here
when the first ship brought the white men to our shores, and
hundreds and hundreds of those whom they call bravest, wisest,
strongest,&mdash;warriors, statesmen, orators, and
poets,&mdash;have been born, have grown up, lived, and died,
while yet it has outlived them all.&nbsp; It has seen more wisdom
than the best of them; but two or three hours of brutal strength
sufficed to lay it low.&nbsp; Which of these dolts could make a
tree?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see them do anything like it.&nbsp;
How noisy and clumsy are all their movements,&mdash;chopping,
pounding, rasping, hammering.&nbsp; And, after all, what do they
build?&nbsp; In the forest we do everything so quietly.&nbsp; A
tree would be ashamed of itself that could not get its growth
without making such a noise and dust and fuss.&nbsp; Our life is
the perfection of good manners.&nbsp; For my part, I feel
degraded at the mere presence of these human beings; but, alas! I
am old; a hollow place at my heart warns me of the progress of
decay, and probably it will be seized upon by these rapacious
creatures as an excuse for laying me as low as my noble green
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of all this disquiet about it, the little cottage
grew and was finished.&nbsp; The walls were covered with pretty
paper, the floors carpeted with pretty carpets; and, in fact,
when it was all arranged, and the garden walks laid out, and beds
of flowers planted around, it began to be confessed, even among
the most critical, that it was not after all so bad a thing as
was to have been feared.</p>
<p>A black ant went in one day and made a tour of exploration up
and down, over chairs and tables, up the ceilings and down again,
and, coming out, wrote an article for the <i>Crickets&rsquo;
Gazette</i>, in which he described the new abode as a veritable
palace.&nbsp; Several butterflies fluttered in and sailed about
and were wonderfully delighted, and then a bumble-bee and two or
three honey-bees, who expressed themselves well pleased with the
house, but more especially enchanted with the garden.&nbsp; In
fact, when it was found that the proprietors were very fond of
the rural solitudes of Nature, and had come out there for the
purpose of enjoying them undisturbed; that they watched and
spared the anemones, and the violets, and bloodroots, and
dog&rsquo;s-tooth violets, and little woolly rolls of fern that
began to grow up under the trees in spring; that they never
allowed a gun to be fired to scare the birds, and watched the
building of their nests with the greatest interest,&mdash;then an
opinion in favour of human beings began to gain ground, and every
cricket and bird and beast was loud in their praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said young Tit-bit, a frisky young
squirrel, to his mother one day, &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you let
Frisky and me go into that pretty new cottage to play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said his mother, who was a very wary
and careful old squirrel, &ldquo;how can you think of it?&nbsp;
The race of man are full of devices for traps and pitfalls, and
who could say what might happen if you put yourself in their
power?&nbsp; If you had wings like the butterflies and bees, you
might fly in and out again, and so gratify your curiosity; but,
as matters stand, it&rsquo;s best for you to keep well out of
their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, there is such a nice, good lady lives
there!&nbsp; I believe she is a good fairy, and she seems to love
us all so; she sits in the bow-window and watches us for hours,
and she scatters corn all round at the roots of the tree for us
to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is nice enough,&rdquo; said the old
mother-squirrel, &ldquo;if you keep far enough off; but I tell
you, you can&rsquo;t be too careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this good fairy that the squirrels discoursed about was a
nice little old lady that the children used to call Aunt Esther,
and she was a dear lover of birds and squirrels, and all sorts of
animals, and had studied their little ways till she knew just
what would please them; and so she would every day throw out
crumbs for the sparrows, and little bits of bread and wool and
cotton to help the birds that were building their nests, and
would scatter corn and nuts for the squirrels; and while she sat
at her work in the bow-window she would smile to see the birds
flying away with the wool, and the squirrels nibbling their
nuts.&nbsp; After a while the birds grew so tame that they would
hop into the bow-window and eat their crumbs off the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, mamma,&rdquo; said Tit-bit and Frisky,
&ldquo;only see Jenny Wren and Cock Robin have been in at the
bow-window, and it didn&rsquo;t hurt them, and why can&rsquo;t we
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dears,&rdquo; said old Mother Squirrel,
&ldquo;you must do it very carefully; never forget that you
haven&rsquo;t wings like Jenny Wren and Cock Robin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next day Aunt Esther laid a train of corn from the
roots of the trees to the bow-window, and then from the
bow-window to her work-basket, which stood on the floor beside
her; and then she put quite a handful of corn in the work-basket,
and sat down by it, and seemed intent on her sewing.&nbsp; Very
soon, creep, creep, creep, came Tit-bit and Frisky to the window,
and then into the room, just as sly and as still as could be, and
Aunt Esther sat just like a statue for fear of disturbing
them.&nbsp; They looked all around in high glee, and when they
came to the basket it seemed to them a wonderful little
summer-house, made on purpose for them to play in.&nbsp; They
nosed about in it, and turned over the scissors and the
needle-book, and took a nibble at her white wax, and jostled the
spools, meanwhile stowing away the corn on each side of their
little chops, till they both of them looked as if they had the
mumps.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

 src="images/p89s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At last Aunt Esther put out her hand to touch them, when,
whisk-frisk, out they went, and up the trees, chattering and
laughing before she had time even to wink.</p>
<p>But after this they used to come in every day, and when she
put corn in her hand and held it very still they would eat out of
it; and finally they would get into her hand, until one day she
gently closed it over them, and Frisky and Tit-bit were fairly
caught.</p>
<p>Oh, how their hearts beat! but the good fairy only spoke
gently to them, and soon unclosed her hand and let them go
again.&nbsp; So day after day they grew to have more and more
faith in her, till they would climb into her work-basket, sit on
her shoulder, or nestle away in her lap as she sat sewing.&nbsp;
They made also long exploring voyages all over the house, up and
through all the chambers, till finally, I grieve to say, poor
Frisky came to an untimely end by being drowned in the water-tank
at the top of the house.</p>
<p>The dear good fairy passed away from the house in time, and
went to a land where the flowers never fade and the birds never
die; but the squirrels still continue to make the place a
favourite resort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, my dear,&rdquo; said old Mother Red one winter
to her mate, &ldquo;what is the use of one&rsquo;s living in this
cold, hollow tree, when these amiable people have erected this
pretty cottage, where there is plenty of room for us and them
too?&nbsp; Now I have examined between the eaves, and there is a
charming place where we can store our nuts, and where we can whip
in and out of the garret, and have the free range of the house;
and, say what you will, these humans have delightful ways of
being warm and comfortable in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mr. and Mrs. Red set up housekeeping in the cottage, and
had no end of nuts and other good things stored up there.&nbsp;
The trouble of all this was, that, as Mrs. Red was a notable
body, and got up to begin her housekeeping operations, and woke
up all her children, at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
good people often were disturbed by a great rattling and fuss in
the walls, while yet it seemed dark night.&nbsp; Then sometimes,
too, I grieve to say, Mrs. Squirrel would give her husband
vigorous curtain lectures in the night, which made him so
indignant that he would rattle off to another quarter of the
garret to sleep by himself; and all this broke the rest of the
worthy people who built the house.</p>
<p>What is to be done about this we don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; What
would you do about it?&nbsp; Would you let the squirrels live in
your house or not?&nbsp; When our good people come down of a cold
winter morning, and see the squirrels dancing and frisking down
the trees, and chasing each other so merrily over the garden
chair between them, or sitting with their tails saucily over
their backs, they look so jolly and jaunty and pretty that they
almost forgive them for disturbing their night&rsquo;s rest, and
think that they will not do anything to drive them out of the
garret to-day.&nbsp; And so it goes on; but how long the
squirrels will rent the cottage in this fashion, I&rsquo;m sure I
dare not undertake to say.</p>

93</span><i>HUM</i>, <i>THE SON OF BUZ</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Rye Beach, during our
summer&rsquo;s vacation, there came, as there always will to
seaside visitors, two or three cold, chilly, rainy
days,&mdash;days when the skies that long had not rained a drop
seemed suddenly to bethink themselves of their remissness, and to
pour down water, not by drops, but by pailfuls.&nbsp; The chilly
wind blew and whistled, the water dashed along the ground and
careered in foamy rills along the roadside, and the bushes bent
beneath the constant flood.&nbsp; It was plain that there was to
be no sea-bathing on such a day, no walks, no rides; and so,
shivering and drawing our blanket-shawls close about us, we sat
down at the window to watch the storm outside.</p>
<p>The rose-bushes under the window hung dripping under their
load of moisture, each spray shedding a constant shower on the
spray below it.&nbsp; On one of these lower sprays, under the
perpetual drip, what should we see but a poor little
humming-bird, drawn up into the tiniest shivering ball, and
clinging with a desperate grasp to his uncomfortable perch.&nbsp;
A humming-bird we knew him to be at once, though his feathers
were so matted and glued down by the rain that he looked not much
bigger than a honey-bee, and as different as possible from the
smart, pert, airy little character that we had so often seen
flirting with the flowers.&nbsp; He was evidently a humming-bird
in adversity, and whether he ever would hum again looked to us
exceedingly doubtful.&nbsp; Immediately, however, we sent out to
have him taken in.&nbsp; When the friendly hand seized him, he
gave a little, faint, watery squeak, evidently thinking that his
last hour was come, and that grim death was about to carry him
off to the land of dead birds.&nbsp; What a time we had reviving
him,&mdash;holding the little wet thing in the warm hollow of our
hands, and feeling him shiver and palpitate!&nbsp; His eyes were
fast closed; his tiny claws, which looked slender as cobwebs,
were knotted close to his body, and it was long before one could
feel the least motion in them.&nbsp; Finally, to our great joy,
we felt a brisk little kick, and then a flutter of wings, and
then a determined peck of the beak, which showed that there was
some bird left in him yet, and that he meant at any rate to find
out where he was.</p>
<p>Unclosing our hands a small space, out popped the little head
with a pair of round brilliant eyes.&nbsp; Then we bethought
ourselves of feeding him, and forthwith prepared him a stiff
glass of sugar and water, a drop of which we held to his
bill.&nbsp; After turning his head attentively, like a bird who
knew what he was about and didn&rsquo;t mean to be chaffed, he
briskly put out a long, flexible tongue, slightly forked at the
end, and licked off the comfortable beverage with great
relish.&nbsp; Immediately he was pronounced out of danger by the
small humane society which had undertaken the charge of his
restoration, and we began to cast about for getting him a settled
establishment in our apartment.&nbsp; I gave up my work-box to
him for a sleeping-room, and it was medically ordered that he
should take a nap.&nbsp; So we filled the box with cotton, and he
was formally put to bed, with a folded cambric handkerchief round
his neck, to keep him from beating his wings.&nbsp; Out of his
white wrappings he looked forth green and grave as any judge with
his bright round eyes.&nbsp; Like a bird of discretion, he seemed
to understand what was being done to him, and resigned himself
sensibly to go to sleep.</p>
<p>The box was covered with a sheet of paper perforated with
holes for purposes of ventilation; for even humming-birds have a
little pair of lungs, and need their own little portion of air to
fill them, so that they may make bright scarlet little drops of
blood to keep life&rsquo;s fire burning in their tiny
bodies.&nbsp; Our bird&rsquo;s lungs manufactured brilliant
blood, as we found out by experience; for in his first nap he
contrived to nestle himself into the cotton of which his bed was
made, and to get more of it than he needed into his long
bill.&nbsp; We pulled it out as carefully as we could, but there
came out of his bill two round, bright scarlet, little drops of
blood.&nbsp; Our chief medical authority looked grave, pronounced
a probable hemorrhage from the lungs, and gave him over at
once.&nbsp; We, less scientific, declared that we had only cut
his little tongue by drawing out the filaments of cotton, and
that he would do well enough in time,&mdash;as it afterwards
appeared he did, for from that day there was no more
bleeding.&nbsp; In the course of the second day he began to take
short flights about the room, though he seemed to prefer to
return to us; perching on our fingers or heads or shoulders, and
sometimes choosing to sit in this way for half an hour at a
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;These great giants,&rdquo; he seemed to say to
himself, &ldquo;are not bad people after all; they have a
comfortable way with them; how nicely they dried and warmed
me!&nbsp; Truly a bird might do worse than to live with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he made up his mind to form a fourth in the little company
of three that usually sat and read, worked and sketched, in that
apartment, and we christened him &ldquo;Hum, the son of
Buz.&rdquo;&nbsp; He became an individuality, a character, whose
little doings formed a part of every letter, and some extracts
from these will show what some of his little ways
were:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum has learned to sit upon my finger, and eat his
sugar and water out of a teaspoon with most Christian-like
decorum.&nbsp; He has but one weakness&mdash;he will occasionally
jump into the spoon and sit in his sugar and water, and then
appear to wonder where it goes to.&nbsp; His plumage is in rather
a drabbled state, owing to these performances.&nbsp; I have
sketched him as he sat to-day on a bit of Spir&aelig;a which I
brought in for him.&nbsp; When absorbed in reflection, he sits
with his bill straight up in the air, as I have drawn him.&nbsp;
Mr. A&mdash; reads Macaulay to us, and you should see the wise
air with which, perched on Jenny&rsquo;s thumb, he cocked his
head now one side and then the other, apparently listening with
most critical attention.&nbsp; His confidence in us seems
unbounded: he lets us stroke his head, smooth his feathers,
without a flutter; and is never better pleased than when sitting,
as he has been doing all this while, on my hand, turning up his
bill, and watching my face with great edification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just been having a sort of maternal struggle to
make him go to bed in his box; but he evidently considers himself
sufficiently convalescent to make a stand for his rights as a
bird, and so scratched indignantly out of his wrappings, and set
himself up to roost on the edge of the box, with an air worthy of
a turkey, at the very least.&nbsp; Having brought in a lamp, he
has opened his eyes round and wide, and sits cocking his little
head at me reflectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the weather cleared away, and the sun came out bright,
Hum became entirely well, and seemed resolved to take the measure
of his new life with us.&nbsp; Our windows were closed in the
lower part of the sash by frames with mosquito gauze, so that the
sun and air found free admission, and yet our little rover could
not pass out.&nbsp; On the first sunny day he took an exact
survey of our apartment from ceiling to floor, humming about,
examining every point with his bill&mdash;all the crevices,
mouldings, each little indentation in the bed-posts, each
window-pane, each chair and stand; and, as it was a very simply
furnished seaside apartment, his scrutiny was soon
finished.&nbsp; We wondered at first what this was all about; but
on watching him more closely, we found that he was actively
engaged in getting his living, by darting out his long tongue
hither and thither, and drawing in all the tiny flies and insects
which in summer time are to be found in an apartment.&nbsp; In
short, we found that, though the nectar of flowers was his
dessert, yet he had his roast beef and mutton-chop to look after,
and that his bright, brilliant blood was not made out of a simple
vegetarian diet.&nbsp; Very shrewd and keen he was, too, in
measuring the size of insects before he attempted to swallow
them.&nbsp; The smallest class were whisked off with lightning
speed; but about larger ones he would sometimes wheel and hum for
some minutes, darting hither and thither, and surveying them
warily, and if satisfied that they could be carried, he would
come down with a quick, central dart which would finish the
unfortunate at a snap.&nbsp; The larger flies seemed to irritate
him, especially when they intimated to him that his plumage was
sugary, by settling on his wings and tail; when he would lay
about him spitefully, wielding his bill like a sword.&nbsp; A
grasshopper that strayed in, and was sunning himself on the
window-seat, gave him great discomposure.&nbsp; Hum evidently
considered him an intruder, and seemed to long to make a dive at
him; but, with characteristic prudence, confined himself to
threatening movements, which did not exactly hit.&nbsp; He saw
evidently that he could not swallow him whole, and what might
ensue from trying him piecemeal he wisely forbore to essay.</p>
<p>Hum had his own favourite places and perches.&nbsp; From the
first day he chose for his nightly roost a towel-line which had
been drawn across the corner over the wash-stand, where he every
night established himself with one claw in the edge of the towel
and the other clasping the line, and, ruffling up his feathers
till he looked like a little chestnut-burr, he would resign
himself to the soundest sleep.&nbsp; He did not tuck his head
under his wing, but seemed to sink it down between his shoulders,
with his bill almost straight up in the air.&nbsp; One evening
one of us, going to use the towel, jarred the line, and soon
after found that Hum had been thrown from his perch, and was
hanging head downward, fast asleep, still clinging to the
line.&nbsp; Another evening, being discomposed by somebody coming
to the towel-line after he had settled himself, he fluttered off;
but so sleepy that he had not discretion to poise himself again,
and was found clinging, like a little bunch of green floss silk,
to the mosquito netting of the window.</p>
<p>A day after this we brought in a large green bough, and put it
up over the looking-glass.&nbsp; Hum noticed it before it had
been there five minutes, flew to it, and began a regular survey,
perching now here, now there, till he seemed to find a twig that
exactly suited him; and after that he roosted there every
night.&nbsp; Who does not see in this change all the signs of
reflection and reason that are shown by us in thinking over our
circumstances, and trying to better them?&nbsp; It seemed to say
in so many words: &ldquo;That towel-line is an unsafe place for a
bird; I get frightened, and wake from bad dreams to find myself
head downwards; so I will find a better roost on this
twig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When our little Jenny one day put on a clean white muslin gown
embellished with red sprigs, Hum flew towards her, and with his
bill made instant examination of these new appearances; and one
day, being very affectionately disposed, perched himself on her
shoulder, and sat some time.&nbsp; On another occasion, while Mr.
A was reading, Hum established himself on the top of his head
just over the middle of his forehead, in the precise place where
our young belles have lately worn stuffed humming-birds, making
him look as if dressed out for a party.&nbsp; Hum&rsquo;s most
favourite perch was the back of the great rocking-chair, which,
being covered by a tidy, gave some hold into which he could catch
his little claws.&nbsp; There he would sit, balancing himself
cleverly if its occupant chose to swing to and fro, and seeming
to be listening to the conversation or reading.</p>
<p>Hum had his different moods, like human beings.&nbsp; On cold,
cloudy, gray days he appeared to be somewhat depressed in
spirits, hummed less about the room, and sat humped up with his
feathers ruffled, looking as much like a bird in a great-coat as
possible.&nbsp; But on hot, sunny days, every feather sleeked
itself down, and his little body looked natty and trim, his head
alert, his eyes bright, and it was impossible to come near him,
for his agility.&nbsp; Then let mosquitoes and little flies look
about them!&nbsp; Hum snapped them up without mercy, and seemed
to be all over the ceiling in a moment, and resisted all our
efforts at any personal familiarity with a saucy alacrity.</p>
<p>Hum had his established institutions in our room, the chief of
which was a tumbler with a little sugar and water mixed in it,
and a spoon laid across, out of which he helped himself whenever
he felt in the mood&mdash;sitting on the edge of the tumbler, and
dipping his long bill, and lapping with his little forked tongue
like a kitten.&nbsp; When he found his spoon accidentally dry, he
would stoop over and dip his bill in the water in the tumbler;
which caused the prophecy on the part of some of his guardians
that he would fall in some&mdash;day and be drowned.&nbsp; For
which reason it was agreed to keep only an inch in depth of the
fluid at the bottom of the tumbler.&nbsp; A wise precaution this
proved; for the next morning I was awaked, not by the usual hum
over my head, but by a sharp little flutter, and found Mr. Hum
beating his wings in the tumbler&mdash;having actually tumbled in
during his energetic efforts to get his morning coffee before I
was awake.</p>
<p>Hum seemed perfectly happy and satisfied in his quarters; but
one day, when the door was left open, he made a dart out, and so
into the open sunshine.&nbsp; Then, to be sure, we thought we had
lost him.&nbsp; We took the mosquito netting, out of all the
windows, and, setting his tumbler of sugar and water in a
conspicuous place, went about our usual occupations.&nbsp; We saw
him joyous and brisk among the honeysuckles outside the window,
and it was gravely predicted that he would return no more.&nbsp;
But at dinner-time in came Hum, familiar as possible, and sat
down to his spoon as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; Instantly we
closed our windows and had him secure once more.</p>
<p>At another time I was going to ride to the Atlantic House,
about a mile from my boarding-place.&nbsp; I left all secure, as
I supposed, at home.&nbsp; While gathering moss on the walls
there, I was surprised by a little green humming-bird flying
familiarly right towards my face and humming above my head.&nbsp;
I called out, &ldquo;Here is Hum&rsquo;s very
brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, on returning home, I saw that the door
of the room was open, and Hum was gone.&nbsp; Now certainly we
gave him up for lost.&nbsp; I sat down to painting, and in a few
minutes in flew Hum, and settled on the edge of my tumbler in a
social, confidential way, which seemed to say, &ldquo;Oh,
you&rsquo;ve got back then.&rdquo;&nbsp; After taking his usual
drink of sugar and water, he began to fly about the ceiling as
usual, and we gladly shut him in.</p>
<p>When our five weeks at the seaside were up, and it was time to
go home, we had great questionings what was to be done with
Hum.&nbsp; To get him home with us was our desire; but who ever
heard of a humming-bird travelling by railroad?&nbsp; Great were
the consultings.&nbsp; A little basket of Indian work was filled
up with cambric handkerchiefs, and a bottle of sugar and water
provided, and we started with him for a day&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; When we arrived at night the first care was to see
what had become of Hum, who had not been looked at since we fed
him with sugar and water in Boston.&nbsp; We found him alive and
well, but so dead asleep that we could not wake him to roost; so
we put him to bed on a toilet cushion, and arranged his tumbler
for morning.&nbsp; The next day found him alive and humming,
exploring the room and pictures, perching now here and now there;
but as the weather was chilly, he sat for the most part of the
time in a humped-up state on the tip of a pair of stag&rsquo;s
horns.&nbsp; We moved him to a more sunny apartment; but, alas!
the equinoctial storm came on, and there was no sun to be had for
days.&nbsp; Hum was blue; the pleasant seaside days were over;
his room was lonely, the pleasant three that had enlivened the
apartment at Rye no longer came in and out; evidently he was
lonesome, and gave way to depression.&nbsp; One chilly morning he
managed again to fall into his tumbler, and wet himself through;
and notwithstanding warm bathings and tender nursings, the poor
little fellow seemed to get diphtheria, or something quite as bad
for humming-birds.</p>
<p>We carried him to a neighbouring sunny parlour, where ivy
embowers all the walls and the sun lies all day.&nbsp; There he
revived a little, danced up and down, perched on a green spray
that was wreathed across the breast of a Psyche, and looked then
like a little flitting soul returning to its rest.&nbsp; Towards
evening he drooped; and, having been nursed and warmed and cared
for, he was put to sleep on a green twig laid on the piano.&nbsp;
In that sleep the little head drooped&mdash;nodded&mdash;fell;
and little Hum went where other bright dreams go&mdash;to the
Land of the Hereafter.</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span><i>OUR COUNTRY NEIGHBOURS</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have just built our house in
rather an out-of-the-way place&mdash;on the bank of a river, and
under the shade of a patch of woods which is a veritable remain
of quite an ancient forest.&nbsp; The checkerberry and
partridge-plum, with their glossy green leaves and scarlet
berries, still carpet the ground under its deep shadows; and
prince&rsquo;s-pine and other kindred evergreens declare its
native wildness,&mdash;for these are children of the wild woods,
that never come after plough and harrow have once broken a
soil.</p>
<p>When we tried to look out the spot for our house, we had to
get a surveyor to go before us and cut a path through the dense
underbrush that was laced together in a general network of boughs
and leaves, and grew so high as to overtop our heads.&nbsp; Where
the house stands, four or five great old oaks and chestnuts had
to be cut away to let it in; and now it stands on the bank of the
river, the edges of which are still overhung with old
forest-trees, chestnuts and oaks, which look at themselves in the
glassy stream.</p>
<p>A little knoll near the house was chosen for a garden-spot; a
dense, dark mass of trees above, of bushes in mid-air, and of all
sorts of ferns and wild-flowers and creeping vines on the
ground.&nbsp; All these had to be cleared out, and a dozen great
trees cut down and dragged off to a neighbouring saw-mill, there
to be transformed into boards to finish off our house.&nbsp;
Then, fetching a great machine, such as might be used to pull a
giant&rsquo;s teeth, with ropes, pulleys, oxen, and men, and
might and main, we pulled out the stumps, with their great prongs
and their network of roots and fibres; and then, alas! we had to
begin with all the pretty wild, lovely bushes, and the
checkerberries and ferns and wild blackberries and
huckleberry-bushes, and dig them up remorselessly, that we might
plant our corn and squashes.&nbsp; And so we got a house and a
garden right out of the heart of our piece of wild wood, about a
mile from the city of H-.</p>
<p>Well, then, people said it was a lonely place, and far from
neighbours,&mdash;by which they meant that it was a good way for
them to come to see us.&nbsp; But we soon found that whoever goes
into the woods to live finds neighbours of a new kind, and some
to whom it is rather hard to become accustomed.</p>
<p>For instance, on a fine day early in April, as we were
crossing over to superintend the building of our house, we were
startled by a striped snake, with his little bright eyes, raising
himself to look at us, and putting out his red, forked
tongue.&nbsp; Now there is no more harm in these little
garden-snakes than there is in a robin or a squirrel&mdash;they
are poor little, peaceable, timid creatures, which could not do
any harm if they would; but the prejudices of society are so
strong against them that one does not like to cultivate too much
intimacy with them.&nbsp; So we tried to turn out of our path
into a tangle of bushes; and there, instead of one, we found four
snakes.&nbsp; We turned on the other side, and there were two
more.&nbsp; In short, everywhere we looked, the dry leaves were
rustling and coiling with them; and we were in despair.&nbsp; In
vain we said that they were harmless as kittens, and tried to
persuade ourselves that their little bright eyes were pretty, and
that their serpentine movements were in the exact line of beauty:
for the life of us, we could not help remembering their family
name and connections; we thought of those disagreeable gentlemen
the anacondas, the rattlesnakes, and the copper-heads, and all of
that bad line, immediate family friends of the old serpent to
whom we are indebted for all the mischief that is done in this
world.&nbsp; So we were quite apprehensive when we saw how our
new neighbourhood was infested by them, until a neighbour calmed
our fears by telling us that snakes always crawled out of their
holes to sun themselves in the spring, and that in a day or two
they would all be gone.</p>
<p>So it proved.&nbsp; It was evident they were all out merely to
do their spring shopping, or something that serves with them the
same purpose that spring shopping does with us; and where they
went afterwards we do not know.&nbsp; People speak of
snakes&rsquo; holes, and we have seen them disappearing into such
subterranean chambers; but we never opened one to see what sort
of underground housekeeping went on there.&nbsp; After the first
few days of spring, a snake was a rare visitor, though now and
then one appeared.</p>
<p>One was discovered taking his noontide repast one day in a
manner which excited much prejudice.&nbsp; He was, in fact,
regaling himself by sucking down into his maw a small frog, which
he had begun to swallow at the toes, and had drawn about half
down.&nbsp; The frog, it must be confessed, seemed to view this
arrangement with great indifference, making no struggle, and
sitting solemnly, with his great unwinking eyes, to be sucked in
at the leisure of his captor.&nbsp; There was immense sympathy,
however, excited for him in the family circle; and it was voted
that a snake which indulged in such very disagreeable modes of
eating his dinner was not to be tolerated in our vicinity.&nbsp;
So I have reason to believe that that was his last meal.</p>
<p>Another of our wild woodland neighbours made us some
trouble.&nbsp; It was no other than a veritable woodchuck, whose
hole we had often wondered at when we were scrambling through the
underbrush after spring flowers.&nbsp; The hole was about the
size of a peck-measure, and had two openings about six feet
apart.&nbsp; The occupant was a gentleman we never had had the
pleasure of seeing, but we soon learned his existence from his
ravages in our garden.&nbsp; He had a taste, it appears, for the
very kind of things we wanted to eat ourselves, and helped
himself without asking.&nbsp; We had a row of fine, crisp heads
of lettuce, which were the pride of our gardening, and out of
which he would from day to day select for his table just the
plants we had marked for ours.&nbsp; He also nibbled our young
beans; and so at last we were reluctantly obliged to let John
Gardiner set a trap for him.&nbsp; Poor old simple-minded hermit,
he was too artless for this world!&nbsp; He was caught at the
very first snap, and found dead in the trap,&mdash;the agitation
and distress having broken his poor woodland heart, and killed
him.&nbsp; We were grieved to the very soul when the poor fat old
fellow was dragged out, with his useless paws standing up stiff
and imploring.&nbsp; As it was, he was given to Denis, our pig,
which, without a single scruple of delicacy, ate him up as
thoroughly as he ate up the lettuce.</p>
<p>This business of eating, it appears, must go on all through
creation.&nbsp; We eat ducks, turkeys, and chickens, though we
don&rsquo;t swallow them whole, feathers and all.&nbsp; Our
four-footed friends, less civilized, take things with more
directness and simplicity, and chew each other up without
ceremony, or swallow each other alive.&nbsp; Of these
unceremonious habits we had other instances.</p>
<p>Our house had a central court on the southern side, into which
looked the library, dining-room, and front hall, as well as
several of the upper chambers.&nbsp; It was designed to be closed
in with glass, to serve as a conservatory in winter; and
meanwhile we had filled it with splendid plumy ferns, taken up
out of the neighbouring wood.&nbsp; In the centre was a fountain
surrounded by stones, shells, mosses, and various
water-plants.&nbsp; We had bought three little goldfish to swim
in our basin; and the spray of it, as it rose in the air and
rippled back into the water, was the pleasantest possible sound
of a hot day.&nbsp; We used to lie on the sofa in the hall, and
look into the court, and fancy we saw some scene of fairy-land,
and water-sprites coming up from the fountain.&nbsp; Suddenly a
new-comer presented himself,&mdash;no other than an immense
bull-frog, that had hopped up from the neighbouring river,
apparently with a view to making a permanent settlement in and
about our fountain.&nbsp; He was to be seen, often for hours,
sitting reflectively on the edge of it, beneath the broad shadow
of the calla-leaves.&nbsp; When sometimes missed thence, he would
be found under the ample shield of a great bignonia, whose
striped leaves grew hard by.</p>
<p>The family were prejudiced against him.&nbsp; What did he want
there?&nbsp; It was surely some sinister motive impelled
him.&nbsp; He was probably watching for an opportunity to gobble
up the goldfish.&nbsp; We took his part, however, and strenuously
defended his moral character, and patronized him in all
ways.&nbsp; We gave him the name of Unke, and maintained that he
was a well-conducted, philosophical old water-sprite, who showed
his good taste in wanting to take up his abode in our
conservatory.&nbsp; We even defended his personal appearance,
praised the invisible-green coat which he wore on his back, and
his gray vest, and solemn gold spectacles; and though he always
felt remarkably slimy when we touched him, yet, as he would sit
still and allow us to stroke his head and pat his back, we
concluded his social feelings might be warm, notwithstanding a
cold exterior.&nbsp; Who knew, after all, but he might be a
beautiful young prince, enchanted there till the princess should
come to drop the golden ball into the fountain, and so give him a
chance to marry her and turn into a man again?&nbsp; Such things,
we are credibly informed, are matters of frequent occurrence in
Germany.&nbsp; Why not here?</p>
<p>By-and-by there came to our fountain another visitor,&mdash;a
frisky, green young frog of the identical kind spoken of by the
poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a frog lived in a well,<br />
Rig dum pully metakimo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This thoughtless, dapper individual, with his bright green
coat, his faultless white vest, and sea-green tights, became
rather the popular favourite.&nbsp; He seemed just rakish and
gallant enough to fulfil the conditions of the song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The frog he would a-courting ride,<br />
With sword and pistol by his side.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lively young fellow, whom we shall call Cri-Cri, like
other frisky and gay young people, carried the day quite over the
head of the solemn old philosopher under the calla-leaves.&nbsp;
At night, when all was still, he would trill a joyous little note
in his throat, while old Unke would answer only with a cracked
guttural more singular than agreeable; and to all outward
appearance the two were as good friends as their different
natures would allow.</p>
<p>One day, however, the conservatory became the scene of a
tragedy of the deepest dye.&nbsp; We were summoned below by
shrieks and howls of horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do pray come down and
see what this vile, nasty, horrid old frog has been
doing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Down we came; and there sat our virtuous old
philosopher, with his poor little brother&rsquo;s hind legs still
sticking out of the corner of his mouth, as if he were smoking
them for a cigar, all helplessly palpitating as they were.&nbsp;
In fact, our solemn old friend had done what many a solemn
hypocrite before has done,&mdash;swallowed his poor brother, neck
and crop,&mdash;and sat there with the most brazen indifference,
looking as if he had done the most proper and virtuous thing in
the world.</p>
<p>Immediately he was marched out of the conservatory at the
point of a walking-stick, and made to hop down to the river, into
whose waters he splashed, and we saw him no more.&nbsp; We regret
to say that the popular indignation was so precipitate in its
results; otherwise the special artist who sketched Hum, the son
of Buz, intended to have made a sketch of the old villain, as he
sat with his luckless victim&rsquo;s hind legs projecting from
his solemn mouth.&nbsp; With all his moral faults, he was a good
sitter, and would probably have sat immovable any length of time
that could be desired.</p>
<p>Of other woodland neighbours there were some which we saw
occasionally.&nbsp; The shores of the river were lined here and
there with the holes of the muskrats; and in rowing by their
settlements, we were sometimes strongly reminded of them by the
overpowering odour of the perfume from which they get their
name.&nbsp; There were also owls, whose nests were high up in
some of the old chestnut-trees.&nbsp; Often in the lonely hours
of the night we could hear them gibbering with a sort of wild,
hollow laugh among the distant trees.&nbsp; But one tenant of the
woods made us some trouble in the autumn.&nbsp; It was a little
flying-squirrel, who took to making excursions into our house in
the night season, coming down the chimney into the chambers,
rustling about among the clothes, cracking nuts or nibbling at
any morsels of anything that suited his fancy.&nbsp; For a long
time the inmates of the rooms were awakened in the night by
mysterious noises, thumps, and rappings, and so lighted candles,
and searched in vain to find whence they came; for the moment any
movement was made, the rogue whipped up the chimney, and left us
a prey to the most mysterious alarms.&nbsp; What could it be?</p>
<p>But one night our fine gentleman bounced in at the window of
another room, which had no fireplace; and the fair occupant,
rising in the night, shut the window, without suspecting that she
had cut off the retreat of any of her woodland neighbours.&nbsp;
The next morning she was startled by what she thought a gray rat
running past her bed.&nbsp; She rose to pursue him, when he ran
up the wall, and clung against the plastering, showing himself
very plainly a gray flying-squirrel, with large, soft eyes, and
wings which consisted of a membrane uniting the fore paws to the
hind ones, like those of a bat.&nbsp; He was chased into the
conservatory, and a window being opened, out he flew upon the
ground, and made away for his native woods, and thus put an end
to many fears as to the nature of our nocturnal rappings.</p>
<p>So you see how many neighbours we found by living in the
woods, and, after all, no worse ones than are found in the great
world.</p>

117</span><i>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF LITTLE WHISKEY</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, at the last, I am going to
tell you something of the ways and doings of one of the queer
little people, whom I shall call Whiskey.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine how pretty he is.&nbsp; His back has the
most beautiful smooth shining stripes of reddish brown and black,
his eyes shine like bright glass beads, and he sits up jauntily
on his hind quarters, with his little tail thrown over his back
like a ruffle.</p>
<p>And where does he live?&nbsp; Well, &ldquo;that is
telling,&rdquo; as we children say.&nbsp; It was somewhere up in
the mountains of Berkshire, in a queer, quaint, old-fashioned
garden, that I made Mr. Whiskey&rsquo;s acquaintance.</p>
<p>Here there lives a young parson, who preaches every Sunday in
a little brown church, and during week-days goes through all
these hills and valleys, visiting the poor, and gathering
children into Sunday schools.</p>
<p>His wife is a very small-sized lady&mdash;not much bigger than
you, my little Mary&mdash;but very fond of all sorts of dumb
animals; and by constantly watching their actions and ways, she
has come to have quite a strange power over them, as I shall
relate.</p>
<p>The little lady fixed her mind on Whiskey, and gave him his
name without consulting him upon the subject.&nbsp; She admired
his bright eyes, and resolved to cultivate his acquaintance.</p>
<p>By constant watching, she discovered that he had a small hole
of his own in the grass-plot a few paces from her
back-door.&nbsp; So she used to fill her pocket with hazel-nuts,
and go out and sit in the back porch, and make a little noise,
such as squirrels make to each other, to attract his
attention.</p>
<p>In a minute or two up would pop the little head with the
bright eyes, in the grass-plot, and Master Whiskey would sit on
his haunches and listen, with one small ear cocked towards
her.&nbsp; Then she would throw him a hazel-nut, and he would
slip instantly down into his hole again.&nbsp; In a minute or
two, however, his curiosity would get the better of his prudence;
and she, sitting quiet, would see the little brown-striped head
slowly, slowly coming up again, over the tiny green spikes of the
grass-plot.&nbsp; Quick as a flash he would dart at the nut,
whisk it into a little bag on one side of his jaws, which Madam
Nature has furnished him with for his provision-pouch, and down
into his hole again.&nbsp; An ungrateful, suspicious little brute
he was too; for though in this way he bagged and carried off nut
after nut, until the patient little woman had used up a pound of
hazel-nuts, still he seemed to have the same wild fright at sight
of her, and would whisk off and hide himself in his hole the
moment she appeared.&nbsp; In vain she called, &ldquo;Whiskey,
Whiskey, Whiskey,&rdquo; in the most flattering tones; in vain
she coaxed and cajoled.&nbsp; No, no; he was not to be caught
napping.&nbsp; He had no objection to accepting her nuts, as many
as she chose to throw to him; but as to her taking any personal
liberty with him, you see, it was by no means to be thought
of.</p>
<p>But at last patience and perseverance began to have their
reward.&nbsp; Little Master Whiskey said to himself,
&ldquo;Surely this is a nice, kind lady, to take so much pains to
give me nuts; she is certainly very considerate;&rdquo; and with
that he edged a little nearer and nearer every day, until, quite
to the delight of the small lady, he would come and climb into
her lap and seize the nuts, when she rattled them there, and
after that he seemed to make exploring voyages all over her
person.&nbsp; He would climb up and sit on her shoulder; he would
mount and perch himself on her head; and when she held a nut for
him between her teeth, he would take it out of her mouth.</p>
<p>After a while he began to make tours of discovery in the
house.&nbsp; He would suddenly appear on the minister&rsquo;s
writing-table when he was composing his Sunday sermon, and sit
cocking his little pert head at him, seeming to wonder what he
was about.&nbsp; But in all his explorations he proved himself a
true Yankee squirrel, having always a shrewd eye on the main
chance.&nbsp; If the parson dropped a nut on the floor, down went
Whiskey after it, and into his provision-bag it went, and then he
would look up as if he expected another; for he had a wallet on
each side of his jaws, and he always wanted both sides handsomely
filled before he made for his hole.&nbsp; So busy and active and
always intent on this one object was he, that before long the
little lady found he had made way with six pounds of
hazel-nuts.&nbsp; His general rule was to carry off four nuts at
a time&mdash;three being stuffed into the side-pockets of his
jaws, and the fourth held in his teeth.&nbsp; When he had
furnished himself in this way, he would dart like lightning for
his hole, and disappear in a moment; but in a short time up he
would come, brisk and wide-awake, and ready for the next
supply.</p>
<p>Once a person who had the curiosity to dig open a chipping
squirrel&rsquo;s hole found in it two quarts of buckwheat, a
quantity of grass-seed, nearly a peck of acorns, some Indian
corn, and a quart of walnuts; a pretty handsome supply for a
squirrel&rsquo;s winter store-room&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think
so?</p>
<p>Whiskey learned in time to work for his living in many artful
ways that his young mistress devised.&nbsp; Sometimes she would
tie his nuts up in a paper package, which he would attack with
great energy, gnawing the strings, and rustling the nuts out of
the paper in wonderfully quick time.&nbsp; Sometimes she would
tie a nut to the end of a bit of twine and swing it backward and
forward over his head; and after a succession of spry jumps, he
would pounce upon it, and hang swinging on the twine, till he had
gnawed the nut away.</p>
<p>Another squirrel, doubtless hearing of Whiskey&rsquo;s good
luck, began to haunt the same yard; but Whiskey would by no means
allow him to cultivate his young mistress&rsquo;s
acquaintance.&nbsp; No indeed! he evidently considered that the
institution would not support two.&nbsp; Sometimes he would
appear to be conversing with the stranger on the most familiar
and amicable terms in the back-yard; but if his mistress called
his name, he would immediately start and chase his companion
quite out of sight, before he came back to her.</p>
<p>So you see that self-seeking is not confined to men alone, and
that Whiskey&rsquo;s fine little fur coat covers a very selfish
heart.</p>
<p>As winter comes on, Whiskey will go down into his hole, which
has many long galleries and winding passages, and a snug little
bedroom well lined with leaves.&nbsp; Here he will doze and dream
away his long winter months, and nibble out the inside of his
store of nuts.</p>
<p>If I hear any more of his cunning tricks, I will tell you of
them.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
